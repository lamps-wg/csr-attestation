The core question here is whether LAMPS / CSR should be specifying encodings other than ASN.1.\r\n\r\nWhat is the rationale for redefining something that is already defined but doesn't use ASN.1 as the data definition language?\r\n\r\nI makes sense to consider the constraints of the environments that are creating the CSR structures and their capabilities. HSMs that already support ASN.1/DER likely will object to some other encoding (e.g., CBOR), but environments that are already capable of CBOR may object to ASN.1/DER etc. Given there are use cases for CSRs originating from various environments such as DICE Protection Environment (DPE), SPDM Responders, and embedded uControllers (but not HSMs). Given there can be layers of compute that may issue a CSR, the CSR draft should be flexible toward accommodating industry evolution and trends rather than serve to constrain or limit such evolution.",

In complex scenarios (such as Composite Devices) the sequence construct allows multiple Evidence payloads to be conveyed in a CSR. In such a situation it is possible to convey a certificate chain with each Evidence payload.\r\n\r\nThe payload construction would be something like:\r\n\r\n               Evidence1\r\n               cert1\r\n               Evidence2\r\n               cert2\r\n\r\nWe have also envisioned the case where the certificate chain is the same for all Evidence payloads.

In his scenario multiple Evidence payloads are sent and their certificate chain only differents by the end entity certificate. In the current design an optimization would not be possible.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Should we allow this optimization? If so, how should we best design it?\r\n",

          "body": "This was discussed over breakfast at 118.\r\n\r\nOut of that discussion we have two changes to make to the document:\r\n\r\n1)\r\nAdd a MUST statement in the EvidenceBundle definition section, something like:\r\n\r\n> All of the EvidenceStatements within a given EvidenceBundle MUST be verifiable with the certificates contained within that EvidenceBundle, or with certificates already known to the verifier. Specifically, verifiers MUST NOT be forced to search the certificates contained in a different EvidenceBundle; if multiple EvidenceBundles require the same certificate(s) in order to verify their EvidenceStatements, then those certificates MUST be duplicated into all EvidenceBundle that requires them.\r\n\r\n\r\n2)\r\nAdd an Implementation Consideration with a worked example of \"the slider\".\r\n\r\n> Section X\r\nProvide an example with:\r\n[EvidenceStatement1] signed by [ [SigningCert1], [DeviceRootCert], [ManufacturerRootCert] ]\r\n[EvidenceStatement2] signed by [ [SigningCert2], [DeviceRootCert], [ManufacturerRootCert] ]\r\nwhere the [DeviceRootCert] and [ManufacturerRootCert] are common to the two evidence statements. This specification provides multiple ways to encode this scenario with the goals of allowing implementers to choose whether they wish to optimize for bandwidth by including a minimal and de-duplicated certificate bundle), or to optimize for computation by providing one-to-one associations of EvidenceStatements and the certificate chains that validate them.\r\n\r\n> Section X.1: Bandwidth-optimized encoding\r\nIf the implementer wishes to optimize for bandwidth, then the CSR producer MAY merge these two certificate chains into a single EvidenceBundle:\r\n```\r\nattr-evidence ATTRIBUTE ::= {\r\n  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement\r\n  SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle {\r\n    EvidenceBundle ::= SEQUENCE\r\n    {\r\n      evidence  SEQUENCE OF EvidenceStatement {\r\n         [EvidenceStatement1], [EvidenceStatement2]\r\n      }\r\n      certs SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives {\r\n         [SigningCert1], [SigningCert2], [DeviceRootCert], [ManufacturerRootCert]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote that bandwidth optimization in this way forces extra computation on the validator (certificate path building) since the certs is not a single ordered certificate chain.\r\n\r\n> Section X.2: Computation-optimized encoding\r\nThis example can equivalently be encoded as two independent EvidenceBundles:\r\n```\r\n\r\nattr-evidence ATTRIBUTE ::= {\r\n  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement\r\n  SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle {\r\n    EvidenceBundle ::= SEQUENCE\r\n    {\r\n      evidence  SEQUENCE OF EvidenceStatement {\r\n         [EvidenceStatement1]\r\n      }\r\n      certs SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives {\r\n         [SigningCert1], [DeviceRootCert], [ManufacturerRootCert]\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    EvidenceBundle ::= SEQUENCE\r\n    {\r\n      evidence  SEQUENCE OF EvidenceStatement {\r\n         [EvidenceStatement2]\r\n      }\r\n      certs SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives {\r\n         [SigningCert2], [DeviceRootCert], [ManufacturerRootCert]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis encoding optimizes for computation in a couple of different ways. First, the CSR producer does not need to merge and de-duplicate the two certificate chains, in fact this encoding could allow the CSR producer to opaquely copy the evidence statements and cert chains without needing to parse them. Second, the verifier does not need to do any complex certificate path building because each evidence statement is bundled one-to-one with the certificate chain against which it can be validated.",

      "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nPlease find my review of the document. Mostly hints except for freshness that I think we need to require or recommend a bit stronger. \r\n\r\nYours, \r\nDaniel \r\n\r\n2 Intro:\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nAt the time of writing, several standard and several proprietary attestation technologies are in use. This specification thereby is intended to be as technology-agnostic as it is feasible with respect to implemented remote attestation technologies. Instead, it focuses on (1) the conveyance of Evidence via CSRs while making minimal assumptions about content or format of the transported Evidence and (2) the conveyance of sets of certificates used for validation of Evidence. The certificates typically contain one or more certification paths rooted in a device manufacture trust anchor and the leaf certificate being on the device in question; the latter is the Attestation Key that signs the Evidence statement. \r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nI would probably add at the end of the paragraph: \r\nEvidences are carried in a Attribute designated as EvidenceStatements, certificates are carried in a CertificateAlternatives. EvidenceStatements and CertificateAlternatives are grouped into EvidenceBundles. \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nThis document specifies two ATTRIBUTE/Attribute definitions. \r\n\"\"\r\n\r\nWe do not really know if one is designated ATTRIBUTE while the other Attribute or if some call these two attributes ATTRIBUTES while other call them Attributes.\r\nIn my opinion, it would be clearer to name directly the Attributes CertificateAlternatives EvidenceStatements.\r\nI would propose the following text:\r\n\r\nThis document specifies two Attributes. The first Attribute is CertificateAlternatives that may be used to carry a set of certificates or public keys that may be required to validate signed Evidence. The second Attribute is  EvidenceStatements that carries a structure that may be used to convey Evidence. These two Attributes combined into a \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nWith these attributes, additional information about whether to issue a certificate and what information to populate into the certificate is available to an RA or CA.\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nI am reading that the content of the evidence will determine the information of in the issued certificate. I THINK these Evidence will determine the issuance of the certificate if they are matching a policy and information provided is determined by policies. In my my opinion we should limit the scope to the policy.    \r\n \r\nThe scope of this document is, however, limited to the conveyance of Evidence within CSR. The exact format of the Evidence being conveyed is defined in various standard and proprietary specifications.\r\n\r\n3 Architecture\r\n\r\n<mglt> \r\nI tend to think we should indicate the CA/RA on the figure, potentially the HSM.\r\n</mglt>\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1 Intercation with an HSM\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nAs discussed in RFC 9334, different security and privacy aspects need to be considered. \r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nI think we should say why. I would for example add:\r\nAs discussed in RFC 9334, different security and privacy aspects need to be considered to enforce trust in the Evidence.\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nFinally, the keying material used by the Attester need to be protected against unauthorized access, and against signing arbitrary content that originated from outside the device.\r\n\"\"\"\r\nTo me that seems to be the primary thing to be listed ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 2 I like OpenSSL and I think it should remain but probably as an example. \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\n the generates and embeds Evidence and the corresponding certificate chains when constructing the CSR.\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nI suspect \"HSM\" is missing I propose:\r\nThe HSM generates and embeds....\r\n\r\nFig 2: I think HSM here is composed of the attestation environment and the service. getEvidence is addressed to the platform sign to the service. I am wondering if we should split these two. Note that I see the service as \"Software\" so maybe I am biassed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nExternally-generated CSRs may require extra round-trips of communication between the CSR generator and the attesting environment, first to obtain the necessary evidence statements about the subject key, and then to use the subject key to sign the CSR. For example, consider a CSR generated by a popular crypto library about a subject key stored on a PKCS#11 [PKCS11] device. \r\n\"\"\"\r\nShould we replace \"evidence statements\" by Evidence ? I do not think that popular is necessary, mentioning \"(like OpenSSL): might be helpful. I know it used to be on the figure.    \r\n4.2. Implementation Strategies\r\n\r\nFig 3 :  the meaning of 0,n are  bit enigmatic to me. In particular I am wondering if inverting 0 and n would change the meaning. I interpret it as meaning between 0 - n. If that is the case, the text mentions one to many, so maybe that needs some clarifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe we could mention  that CertificateAlternatives represents various format of certificates I propose to complement the last sentence of the paragraph to:\r\nEach EvidenceBundle contains one or multiple EvidenceStatement structures as well as one or many CertificateAlternatives which enable to carry various format of certificates. \r\n\r\n \r\n\"\"\"\r\nSingle Attester, which only distributes Evidence without any certificate chains, i.e. the Verifier is assumed to be in possession of the certificate chain already or there is no certificate chain.  \r\n\"\"\"\r\nI think what the last sentence is saying is the say the statements are not signed. \r\nIf so, \"or there is no certificate chain.\" should be replaced by \"or statements ar enot signed.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\"\"\"\r\nIt may be possible that there is an overlap in the certificate chains transmitted by the different Attesters. \r\n\"\"\"\r\nI think we can be more specific and say: \r\nThis may result in certificates being duplicated across multiple EvidenceBundles.\r\n\r\nImplementation strategies to order certificates are only useful if they can be used, so I suspect we should provide some requirements such as the strategies described here MUST be supported and Certificates MUST be ordered from leaf to top. We should also  specify whether the root CA needs to be placed probably a SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT. A verifier SHOULD NOT make any assumption.... \r\n\r\n\r\n5.2 Evidence Attribute and Extension\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nThe hint is intended for an Attester to indicate to the Relying Party which Verifier should be invoked to parse this statement. \r\n\"\"\"\r\nWe need to specify that RP will designate later the Relaying party. I propose to change \"Relying Party\" to \"Relying Party (RP)\"\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nIn many cases, the type OID will already uniquely indicate which Verifier to invoke, but in some cases it may still be ambiguous, or the type may indicate another layer of conceptual message wrapping in which case it is helpful to the RP to bring this hint outside of the statement. \r\n\"\"\"\r\nI think we need to explicitly mention why the OID will indicate the Verifier. I suspect the reasoning is that OID will be vendor specific and Verifier will be vendor specific as well. I expect that verifier will be also configured by the client and as such who will send the CSR but such authentication will be made outside the scope of the CSR.\r\nI understand that hint indicates the Verifier. Do we expect the hint to be something like a FQDN ? \r\nOne thing one need to consider is that I have the impression the hint cannot be trusted unless the CSR is generated by the attesting environment.  If that is correct, we probably need to be cautious regarding that hint and mention it in the security considerations. \r\n\r\n\r\nI do not clearly see what id-ata represents. I have the impression this is the arc under which all Evidence Statement will be registered. id-ata.1, id-ata.2, ... will represent evidence statements. This specific evidence statements are represented by the EvidenceStatementSet structure.\r\n\r\nI am reading that id-aa-evidenceStatement represents EvidenceBundles. If so I am wondering why do not we call it id-aa-evidenceBundles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following text is quite obscure to me:\r\n\"\"\"\r\nWe are leaving the SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle since it is in general more flexible than relying on the containing structure to handle multiplicity and allows for this structure to be re-used in the future in other PKIX protocol contexts.\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\n7: Security Consideration\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nA PKCS#10 or CRMF Certification Request message consists of a distinguished name, a public key, and optionally a set of attributes, collectively signed by the entity requesting certification. \r\n\"\"\"\r\nWell with DN being the certificate Subject I think it can be empty. I woudl propose to replace distinguished name by an identity or identifier. \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nThe private key used to sign the CSR MUST be different from the Attesting Key utilized to sign Evidence about the Target Environment. \r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nThis seems correct - at least in general -, but I am questioning we never never never have a case where a root CA requests a CSR... \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nKey separation is an important principle in cryptography and also applies to this specification with regards to the Attestation Key and the CSR signing key.\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nI do not really understand the sentence, CSR the key is signing the CSR prove the ownership of the key for which a certificate is issued. Evidences are signed to authenticate thetrust of the evidences. I guess I am missing something here.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nFor example, one implementation may perform a software measurement of the CSR library along with the crypto library implementation that has access to the keying material.\r\n\"\"\"\r\nI am reading software measurement as the CSR being a target environment.  \r\nIf the CSR library is outside the attesting environment, it is unclear to me how it can be attested unless we are in a multi attester use case. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nNone of these things are practical when interacting with Hardware Security Modules (HSM).\r\n\"\"\"\r\nI think I disagree here and we need to have freshness or at least some lifetime for Evidences. TLS or ACME  are ways to provide a nonce that needs to be considered during the attestation. We should strongly recommend to implement freshness. It is correct that freshness can be implemented in various ways, including a simple serial number. The threat model seems simple, the key is generated on a HSM, the crypto becomes weak, I can generate the key on my raspberry pie, the CSR can be used for that key - while all certificate have expired. CSR are not necessarily encrypted.   \r\n",

This section is meant to be examples / informative. I think that if we try to make this section normative, then we will get into trouble.\r\n\r\nIn general, we are providing containers and want to leave room for an Attester and Verifier from the same vendor to use these structures however they want.\r\n\r\nIn particular, if we say anything about mandatory certificate order, then we make it hard for cases where we want to include multiple cert chains, or multiple partial cert chains in a single EvidenceBundle. We decided at a meeting that things like P12 files already require certificate parsing clients to be able to handle bags of certificates in arbitrary order that may contain extra certs not needed for a specific Leaf -> CA path, so it is fair to also expect this of Verifiers. If a given vendor's Verifier cannot do this, then they should construct their Evidence accordingly, but I do not think that the specification should arbitrarily restrict those of us with proper certificate path building logic :)\r\n\r\nSimilar reasoning for whether the Root should be placed or not. For example, in complex cross-certified or bridged PKIs it is possible that a self-signed root certificate is not in your trust store, but it is cross-signed as a subordinate of a root that is. So in that case the Attester would need to include the root cert in the EvidenceBundle.\r\n\r\nI think that making any restrictions here on what may be in the certificate list will make it impossible to transmit certain complex PKIs, only for the benefit of simple PKIs that do not implement 5280 path-building properly :)",

How the CA does that is up to the CA with Attestation being one of the acceptable methods; various signed letters and screenshots of admin consoles being another. So IF (Code_Signing); THEN hardware check must have been done.\r\n\r\nWe already had this text buried down in the Security Considerations.\r\n\r\n> The Code-Signing Baseline Requirements [CSBR] document is an example of such a policy that has been published by the CA Browser Forum and specifies certain properties, such as non-exportability, which must be enabled for storing publicly-trusted code-signing keys.

      "body": "1) \"Lead Attester\" is not defined anywhere, but used in multiple places.   A paragraph on that role and its responsibilities appears to be necessary.\r\n2) Section 4.2 needs subsections for each of the cases.   At least one diagram has both a caption and free floating identifiers (e.g. \"Implementation strategy 4b\" vs \"Figure 7....\") that are indistinguishable from body text. There needs to be a way to differentiate between body text and a title for the various cases and objects.     So a) split Figure 7 into two different figures, b) have a section on \"Case 4\" with subsections on \"Implementation Strategy 4a\" and \"Implementation Strategy 4b\" with the appropriate figures from Figure 7 within the section boundaries.  This is mostly editorial, but needs cleanup for figuring out which text paragraph belongs with which diagram.\r\n4.2 - How to encode\r\n4.2.1 - Case 1 - Single Evidence Bundle\r\n4.2.2 - Case 2 - Single Evidence Bundle with Certificates\r\n4.2.3 - Case 3 - Multiple Evidence Bundles each with complete Paths\r\n4.2.4 - Case 4 - Multiple Evidence Bundles with Certificate Transmission Optimization\r\n4.2.4.1 - Strategy 4a\r\n4.2.4.2 - Strategy 4b.\r\n\r\n3) Can Case 1 (where the validator is thought to know some of Case 1's certificates) be encoded as part of Case 4?  I.e., is it legal to have an EvidenceBundle with no certificates as part of any of Case 4?  Or for that matter Case 3?  \r\n4) What knowledge must a \"Leader Attester\" have to select between each of the cases for encoding?   I.e., pre-configured?, some policy object they got?  Specific guidance from each of the possible validators each wanting the same data formatted in a specific way to make their lives easier?\r\n5) Must a validator that can handle Case 3, must also be able to go looking for certs in other bundles if the chain for a given bundle can't be built for validation?  Or must that be treated as a non-validation error by the validator?\r\n6) May a 4B output contain multiple EvidenceBundles each looking like 4B but with a partially disjoint set of certificates?  The description for 4b looks more like case 3 than a special case of 4.\r\n7) May you mix and match the various cases?  And must a Validator be required to riffle through all the various bundles to find the right mix of certificates to validate a given evidence statement?\r\nText needs to be written to cover answers for each of these I believe.\r\n8) Evidence Hint appears to be a way to convey type data that's otherwise buried inside of an Evidence Object of identical top-level types.  This seems to be laziness to not require different OIDs for different pseudo-wrapped and typed evidence statements from DICE ConceptualMessageWrapper (the example, but also handwaving other possibilities).  Recommend elimination of this and putting the onus on the post-processing software to do the differentiation if the proponents of these types of objects don't want to request multiple OIDs.  I don't find the arguments for inclusion convincing.  \r\n9) The TPM example needs work, A2.3\r\n9a)  \r\nThe structure here needs to be de-OCTET STRING'd.\r\nE.g. \r\nTpmV2Attest ::= OCTET STRING -- This is formatted as the encoding of <tpmv2 structures, TPMS_ATTEST>.  \r\n                                                        -- This may be any of the valid attestation structures. For a signature over a public key, only a hash of related public key data is included under the signature.\r\nTpm2InternalSig ::= OCTET STRING -- This is formatted as the encoding of <tpmv2 structures TPMT_SIGNATURE>.  This structure includes the type of signature as well as the actual signature bytes/bits \r\nTpm2Public ::= OCTET STRING -- This is formatted as <tpmv2 structures TPMT_PUBLIC>.  This structure includes the type of key as well as the key bytes.  This is the key being signed.\r\n\r\nTcg-csr-certify ::= SEQUENCE {\r\n   tpmSAttest ::= TpmV2Attest,\r\n   tpmSignature :: = Tpm2InternalSig, -- This is the signature returned by a call to TPM2_Certify over the tpmSAttest object.\r\n   tpmTPublic ::= Tpm2Public OPTIONAL -- This is REQUIRED if the attestation is over a public key  (e.g. if TPMS_ATTEST.type == ???) as it's the only way to map from the key being attested to the attestation.\r\n}\r\n9b) tcg-kp-AIKCertificateField????   This is an extended key purpose OID.  There is no field that contains the AIK certificate.  \r\n9c) A2.5.1 - the TPMU_ATTEST field is a Union identified by .type.  The TPMS_CERTIFY_INFO is union value of what's certified for a public key\r\n9d) If you've got TPMU_ATTEST, you need to explain how to get from Tpm2Public (TPMT_PUBLIC) to the value of the attested field.\r\n9e) Sample CSR - how does the lead attester know what software is installed on the validator's side (e.g. package tpmverifier.example.com)?   This implies there needs to be a registry mapping \"hints\" to something global.  In any event, if you have the OID and you have the structure definitions pointed to that OID, then the Hint is extraneous.  If the validator has multiple ways of resolving a TPMv2 attestation, they're doing it wrong.  Repeat my recommendation to remove hints.\r\n10) Should additional CMS error codes be added for this new extension?  E.g. RFC5272, section 6.1.1 - ExtendedFailInfo.  I don't see how CMCStatus or CMCFailInfo can be extended to cover the possible chaining errors and evidence/validator mismatches.  Ditto for CMP?\r\nLater, Mike\r\n",

This can be covered by example code. Regarding tpmTPublic being OPTIONAL. There are use cases where the verifier may already have this information. For example, if key1 was just created at the request of a remote service. The remote service may have kept this structure as it is the exact structure sent during key1's creations. In this case, the remote server just wants to verify that the key's properties it requested are the properties created in the TPM for the key.

          "body": "Is this issue asking to do something? \r\nAssuming there is general agreement on a definition of key attestation. The salient part is whether or not an AE (cryptographic token) can assert properties of keys. The basic building block of such a statement are (a) naming the key in question (b) describing its properties.\r\n\r\nThe PKI Consortium suggests that the property that is most important is: \"key pair was generated and is managed inside a hardware security module\"\r\n\r\nThe entity making the claim, i.e. the \"hardware security module\" a.k.a., AE also needs to be named. \r\n\r\nThe statement semantics would be: \r\nHSM_A says KEY_X has the property \"key pair was generated and is managed inside a hardware security module\"\r\n\r\nRATS Evidence might rely on a signed object such as JWT/CWT/CSR where the signing key speaks on behalf of the AE. The assumption is the AE (HSM) has been endorsed by a trustworthy entity (e.g., its vendor) usually in the form of an endorsement certificate issued by the vendor CA that identifies the AE. Typically, this is in the form of a device ID certificate where the device ID key is embedded in the AE at manufacturing time (or by a secure process) such that the HSM and HSM key are considered to be the same entity. \r\n\r\nSince KEY_A is under the control of the HSM, the HSM key can sign statements about KEY_A. Such as: \"key pair was generated and is managed inside the HSM_A hardware security module\".\r\n\r\nIf the signed object is the CSR (as that is what's relevant to this I-D), then there needs to be a way to encode the identity of KEY_A (e.g., key-id) and the statement above. There are lots of ways to encode the statement, text string, OID, a single bit. \r\n\r\nThe lamps/csr-attestation I-D has focused on providing a way to include Evidence in a CSR but stops short of defining specific statements. For that, there is a RATS draft https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ounsworth-rats-x509-evidence/\r\n\r\nIt seems this draft is the logical place to define an evidence statement for: \r\nHSM_A says KEY_X has the property \"key pair was generated and is managed inside the HSM_A hardware security module\"\r\n\r\nScanning this I-D it seems to have some building block \"Claims\" that could be used to construct the above statement. For example, the HSM might be given an OEMID, HWMODEL, HWVERSION etc. It might contain some firmware (SOFTWARE-COMPONENT) and it might have some operational characteristics (DBGSTAT).  The HSM might be evaluated, such that an Endorser might want to assert (FIPS_CONF or CC_CONF). \r\n\r\nHowever, these properties seem to describe the HSM and not the key. For example, there is not discussion on how to identify a key (key-id). \r\n\r\nThere is no attention to encoding the properties of a key.\r\n\r\nThere is no attention to how a device ID key (aka endorsement key) might be bound to an HSM such that it can \"speak for\" the objects the HSM controls (such as KEY_A). \r\n\r\nA TPM (as a form of HSM) does have the above capabilities and https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rats-yang-tpm-charra/ documents how that works for TPMs. \r\n\r\nIt seems draft-ounsworth-rats-x509-evidence could do a better job of describing key attestation by filling the gaps I've pointed out.  \r\n",

You can however calculate \r\nthe TPM2B_NAME from a TPMT_PUBLIC object, and you can match a \r\nTPMT_PUBLIC to an SPKI allowing you to verify that the attestation is \r\nabout the public key in the CSR.   This makes the TPMT_PUBLIC mandatory \r\nto complete the attestation of a public key, not optional.   A \r\ndiscussion of how to map across this set of relationships rather than \r\ngoing into details of the various structures appears necessary or at \r\nleast pointers to the sections in the TPM documents.\r\n\r\n2) (Section A.2.5.5) There's a TPM2B_DATA qualifyingData argument to the \r\nTPM2_Certify command that can be used to provide nonce data.  To verify \r\nthe attestation, you need to know what nonce the TPM used to form it.   \r\nThere needs to be a field in Tcg-csr-tpm-certify to provide for the \r\ncarriage of this value.  If it's omitted, a standard value is provided \r\nat the time of the creation of the attestation.  \"qualifyingData\" is an \r\ninput used in all 6 of the TPM certify commands and should not be \r\nomitted from the example. It may be optional in the structure, but must \r\nnot be omitted if the attestation formation used qualifyingData.\r\n\r\n3) A.2.5.2 - \"This document will specifically define...\" seems to imply \r\nthat you can safely ignore the TPMV2 documents definition of TPMT_PUBLIC \r\nin favor of this documents definition- that seems strange.\r\n\r\n4) Same section.  If you're going to expand the TPMA_OBJECT structure, \r\nit might be useful to describe what a relying party might want to check \r\nhere.  E.g. generated on the TPM, not extractable, either a signing, key \r\nagreement or encrypting and not a restricted key.\r\n\r\n5) A.2.5.3 - You've chosen to carry the signature in the TPM way - it \r\ncould also be carried in a PKIX way.  Either is valid, the second might \r\nbe easier for a relying party to handle.\r\n\r\n6) Most of the A.2.5 section would be better if removed and replaced \r\nwith document references to the actual TPMV2 documents.\r\n\r\n7) A.2.6 - I'm assuming that the CA certificate in the CSR \r\nEvidenceBundle.certs is the CA certificate that signed the AK. I'm \r\nunclear why it's here unless its an intermediate CA subordinate to a \r\nwell known root of trust. (Looking at the asn1 dump, that doesn't seem \r\nto be the case).\r\n\r\n8) Some discussion of what information the verifier needs to give you an \r\nanswer might be useful.  (e.g afaict, a Verifier needs the CSR's key to \r\nbe certified, the TPMT_PUBLIC content octets, the signature content \r\noctets and the attestation content octets.  Or it needs to be able to \r\nparse ASN1 from the entire CSR.\r\n\r\nItem's 1 and 2 need to be fixed.  (3) may need to be fixed, or at least \r\nreworded.  Items 4-8 would add useful content, but are mostly a don't \r\ncare from my point of view.\r\n\r\nLater, Mike",

It is already allocated for something else.\n\nThere is a formatting problem in Appendix A.4.  I cannot figure it out; markdown went haywire.\n\nIn Appendix B, I am very uncomfortable with the OID assignments:\n\n    id-aa OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 1 2 840 113549 1 9 16 2 }\n    -- IMPORTed FROM SecureMimeMessageV3dot1\n\n   id-ata OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aa (TBD1) }\n\n   id-aa-evidence OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ata 59 }\n\nThere is already an allocation for this OID.

PLEASE change it back to:\n\n   id-aa-evidence OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aa 59 }\n\nThis seems to be a muddling between id-aa-ar and id-aa-ata.

The RA needs to be careful not to modify aspects of the CSR that would invalidate the binding with the attestation data and the CSR -- for example if the attestation carries a device identifier which needs to match the DN but the RA modifies the DN.\n* RA consumes the Evidence and replaces it with Attestation Result. This splits into a number of sub-cases:\n     * Implicit AR: RA consumes the attestation data and removes it; the fact that the CSR passed the RA counts as a kind of boolean AR.\n     * AR is contained in a CSR attribute / extension that is intended to be copied into the issued certificate (this is not defined in this specification, but we leave open the possibility for this in the future.).\n     * Explicit AR intended to be consumed and verified by the CA.

This allows the CA to delegate the PoP validation to the RA. Specifically when the RA needs to change the content of the the certReq field the raVerified choice is handy.\nIn case the CA did not delegate the PoP validation to the RA, the RA could, depending on the certificate management protocol used, either put the original certReq containing the valid PoP into the regInfo field of the new certReqMsg (I guess this is how CMC is handling this case) or put the original  PKIMessage containing the valid PoP into the generalInfo field of the header of the new PKIMessage signed by the RA, see [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-lamps-rfc4210bis-18#section-5.1.1.3](url).\n\n> At a quick glance, I don't see anything in RFC4211 describing how an RA would add a counter-signature, but presumably there exist CRMF extensions for this?

That would agree with popo being an optional field. Hendrik would know for sure.\n\nCRMF is a format and not a protocol. Therefore, it leaved this question to the certificate management protocol using CRMF.\nIn CMP we described this use case in [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9483#section-5.2.3](url) and [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9483#section-5.3.1](url).",

      "body": "1) The \"hint\" field and it's processing continues to be underspecified.  The body of the document actually refers to the non-normative examples in the appendix rather than giving a precise explanation of how to process the hint field.  The \"hint\" field, as defined, suggests that the verifier architecture being proposed is somewhat problematic in that there MUST be a separate process or server that's responsible for verifying the attestation, and that there may be multiple servers or processes that are responsible for verifying a specific attestation type (e.g. as identified by the \"type\" field in the evidence statement.)  How a CA should process a CSR for which an unknown hint is provided does not appear to be specified for example. Nor how to deal with multiple competing verifiers all claiming to be able to verify a given evidence type.  The document specifies how the hint is placed, but not how it should be processed.\n\n2) EVIDENCE-STATEMENT is defined using the TYPE-IDENTIFIER construct, but the instantiation of this (EvidenceStatement) has an optional field - the aforementioned \"hint\".  As a general matter, a better definition would include an argument indicating whether or not the \"hint\" field should or should not be populated for a given definition of EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.  See below.\n\n3) The \"hint\" field is defined as \"IA5String\" because the format of the field is an ASCII domain name and possibly a port number.  Unfortunately, that makes the field unusable for any other attestation type that may want to use the field for a meaning specific to its attestation type.  E.g. say an ASN1 structured field that gives additional - non-attester-signed information that may be used to map raw information in the attestation to something a PKIX system understands.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe current definition of the EVIDENCE-STATEMENT and its instantiation is:\n\n\nEVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER\n\nEvidenceStatementSet EVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= {\n   ... -- None defined in this document --\n}\n\nEvidenceStatement ::= SEQUENCE {\n   type   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&id({EvidenceStatementSet}),\n   stmt   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&Type({EvidenceStatementSet}{@type}),\n   hint   IA5String OPTIONAL\n}\n\n\nSo defining a specific type of evidence statement would be \"MikesStatement EVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= MikesASN1Structure IDENTIFIED BY id-mikes-statement\" where MikesASN1Structure would be defined elsewhere.\n\nConsidering (2) only, a better definition would be.  (Note that \"TYPE-IDENTIFIER\" is actually a well-known CLASS definition - there is no more complexity here in a CLASS definition than you would find using TYPE-IDENTIFIER)\n\nEVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= CLASS {\n  &id              OBJECT IDENTIFIER UNIQUE,\n  &Type,\n  &hintPresent     ParamOptions DEFAULT required,\n} WITH SYNTAX {\n  &Type IDENTIFIED BY &id\n  [HINT IS &ancillaryPresent]\n}\n\nAllowing for \"MikesStatement EVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= MikesASN1Structure IDENTIFIED BY id-mikes-statement HINT IS absent\".  And allowing the relying party to know whether or not the absence of a hint is an error.\n\n\nBut considering (2) and (3) - the more correct definition would be:\n\nEVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= CLASS {\n  &id           OBJECT IDENTIFIER UNIQUE,\n  &Type,\n  &ancillaryPresent       ParamOptions DEFAULT absent,\n  &AncillaryType   DEFAULT OCTET STRING\n} WITH SYNTAX {\n  &Type IDENTIFIED BY &id\n  [ANCILLARY [TYPE &AncillaryType] IS &ancillaryPresent]\n\n}\n\nEvidenceStatementSet EVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= {\n   ... -- None defined in this document --\n}\n\nEvidenceStatements ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF EvidenceStatement\n\nEvidenceStatement ::= SEQUENCE {\n   type   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&id({EvidenceStatementSet}),\n   stmt   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&Type({EvidenceStatementSet}{@type}),\n   ancillary   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&AncillaryType({EvidenceStatementSet}{@ancillaryType}) OPTIONAL\n}\n\n\nAllowing for \"MikesStatement EVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= MikesASN1Structure IDENTIFIED BY id-mikes-statement ANCILLARY TYPE MikesAncillary IS required\"\n\nIf I want to allow the authors to not have to change their \"EVIDENCE-STATEMENT\" definitions, I would change ancillaryPresent to \"DEFAULT preferredPresent\"  (\"required\"?) and ancillary type to \"DEFAULT IA5String\".\n\nThis doesn't fix the overall problem with the \"hint\" field nor with the general \"requires an external verifier\" architecture implied by the way this is written, but does allow for important flexibility that's missing in the current definition.\n\n_______________________________  END Shepherd text\n\n\nNit:  If the \"hint\" field is restricted to a set of characters or even a pattern, then a Hint type should be defined consisting of \"IA5String (CONTAINING ...)\".  E.g. the ASN1 equivalent of BNF for the field.  This field is well-defined structure wise in the text, so the ASN1 should reflect that definition to allow for automated checking for processing units compiled from this ASN1.\n\nNit: EvidenceStatementSet - multiple places - has \"... -- None defined in this document --\" in its body.  Given that there appear to be at least two EVIDENCE-STATEMENT definitions in the body of this draft (both using real OIDs rather than example OIDs), perhaps this is incorrect?\n\nNit: The section 7.3.2 references for original registry contents are bogus as to all of the TCG/TPM references.   The references here should be to where specific EVIDENCE-STATEMENTs are defined, not to where the OIDs are mentioned.  If there are no defined EVIDENCE-STATEMENTS for a given OID, then delete the registration.\n\nNit: The section 7.3 IANA considerations for the registry definition should use the language from 5226 and should use one of the specific terms - e.g. \"Document Required\" or \"Standard Required\" etc.\n\nNit: Section7.3.2 again - \"Change Controller\".  This is a somewhat weird nomenclature.  I would note somewhere that this is actually the document controller, and that updates of the reference will only be accepted for changes to the definition which meet general ASN1 extensibility rules.  E.g. if there are no \"...\" in the structure definition, then there are no updates possible...  Perhaps instead there is a column indicating whether the base definition is meant to be extensible?\n\nNote that the definition I gave above for EVIDENCE-STATEMENT was mostly the same as my original definition of the ATTESTATION-STATEMENT in the pre-adoption draft, so this should not be a surprise to the authors.\n\nLater, Mike",

          "body": "Proposed responses:\n\n\n1, 2, 3:\nYou've raised these objections already multiple times. The authors have discussed it multiple times, and we are happy with the current specification. It's insane to me how much this this draft has been delayed over a completely OPTIONAL part that is on purpose an under-specified hint.  If you don't want to use the hint in your application, fine. Maybe it will turn out to be useless and nobody uses it, also fine. \n\nSentences like this tell me that you fundamentally don't understand what we're trying do to with the hint:\n\n\"Allowing for \"MikesStatement EVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= MikesASN1Structure IDENTIFIED BY id-mikes-statement HINT IS absent\". And allowing the relying party to know whether or not the absence of a hint is an error.\"\n\nIf your ASN.1 / OID already uniquely defines whether or not a hint should be present, then you probably don't need the hint because it's likely already fully-specified enough. The hint is a place for a proprietary Attester to communicate to the RP that this data would be easiest to parse with a given proprietary verifier instead of whatever default thing the RP would otherwise try. I can't imagine a case where absence of a hint would be an error; that just means that the RP doesn't get a hint to help with format-sniffing. The hint is intended to be completely non-normative in every possible way.\n\n\nWe're done spending time debating the hint. Done now.\n\n\n\n\nYou say:\n\n\"Nit: EvidenceStatementSet - multiple places - has \"... -- None defined in this document --\" in its body. Given that there appear to be at least two EVIDENCE-STATEMENT definitions in the body of this draft (both using real OIDs rather than example OIDs), perhaps this is incorrect?\"\n\nCan you please point to where you see that in the body? I see Appendix A.1. Extending EvidenceStatementSet, but I do not consider that to be in the body or normative enough to be worth including in the core ASN.1 definition.\n\n\n\nYou say:\n\n\"Nit: The section 7.3.2 references for original registry contents are bogus as to all of the TCG/TPM references. The references here should be to where specific EVIDENCE-STATEMENTs are defined, not to where the OIDs are mentioned. If there are no defined EVIDENCE-STATEMENTS for a given OID, then delete the registration.\"\n\nRespectfully disagree. This is a registry of \"OIDs you might see in the wild\". Whether or not a specification exists which does the trivial thing of defining an EVIDENCE-STATEMENTS for it is rather irrelevant.\n\nAlso, I take this comment to be non-constructive filibustering: EVIDENCE-STATEMENTS is defined in this document, which is not yet published, so how could there be any 3rd party specifications that use it? I take this comment to be a complicatedly-worded attempt to have us delete this section, and I don't appreciate it.\n\n\n\nYou say:\n\n\"Nit: The section 7.3 IANA considerations for the registry definition should use the language from 5226 and should use one of the specific terms - e.g. \"Document Required\" or \"Standard Required\" etc.\"\n\nUmm. \"Document Required\" is not defined in [RFC5226]. However \"Designated Expert\" is, so I believe that the current wording of this section already satisfies your comment. That said, on re-reading [RFC5226], \"Specification Required\" does more accurately cover the intention here, so I will change \"Designated Expert\" to \"Specification Required\". Thanks.\n\n \"Document controller\" vs \"Change controller\": I see where you're coming from, but since we want to allow for proprietary data formats to be listed here, I think ",

          "body": "I think you need to remove the AttestationResults text and ASN1.  Basically, it's fine to sort of let the attester to verifier be many different types (e.g. TPM, conceptual wrappers, etc) and depend on a third party to provide Verifiers, but you can't really do that with the Verifier to CA/RA link.\n\nAn attestation result IMHO needs to be a concrete, standard result with perhaps a few different optional components.  It needs to be signed by a verifier, and it should be understandable by the CA/RA.  E.g. it needs to be PKIX from top to bottom with no opaque fields. \n\nAs a minimum, the AttestationResult is going to need to look something like:\n\nSignedAttestationResult ::= SIGNED {AttestationResult}\n\nAttestationResult ::= SEQUENCE {\n      keyLink CHOICE {  -- The attestation must be cryptographicly associated with the key being bound to a certiicate\n            keyId SEQUENCE {    \n                  hashType OBJECT IDENTIFIER,\n                  hash OCTET STRING },\n            key  SubjectPublicKeyInfo }\n      keyInfo  KeyAttrs,\n      entityInfo EntityAttrs,\n      verifierInfo VerifierAttrs }\n\nThe first part of this is just linking the attestation result to the key being certified.  The CA/RA needs to verify what the Verifier is talking about in a secure manner.  \n\nThe next part is the translation of the various EvidenceStatements into something the CA/RA can use to determine whether or not to issue a certificate.\n\nKeyAttrs is probably a BIT STRING representing standard key attributes (e.g. generated in hardware, not extractable, etc), followed by an optional SEQUENCE of CHOICE of either OID or SingleAttribute.  That second part is mostly extensions of the first part and provides for non BOOLEAN attributes if necessary.  It's possible this just reduces to a sequence of OID that represents the policies the key meets.\n\nEntityAttrs is probably similar to KeyAttrs - but describes the entity containing the key/attesting the key.  Things like hardware version, device type, firmware version/date.  \n\nI think that ALL of that is way past the scope of this document and, if kept, won't be able to progress.   It's currently a kitchen sink sitting on a couple of saw horses with neither the water hooked up to the faucets nor the drain hooked to the drain hole.\n\n",

Because it's signed by the Attester, and the Verifier can't modify that.\r\nRATS does not define a protocol between RP and Verifier: we have to pick one or design one.\r\nYour initial proposal that it's a proprietary popen(\"|hsm-manufacturer-module\") is probably a good one for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You want to keep your certified FIPS or CC boundary as small as possible; there's absolutely no reason to have your CSR-generation code inside it. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the CSR is probably constructed by CAPI or openssl or certbot or whatever application, and passed to the HSM over P11 as bytes to be signed. I wouldn't consider openssl or certbot running on a server adjacent to the HSM to be any sort of TE any more than nginx is a TE when it needs to use a TLS key stored on an HSM; I think it's an application making use of the HSM.",

These evidence claims can include information about the hardware component's manufacturer, the version of installed or running firmware, the version of software installed or running in layers above the firmware, or the presence of hardware components providing specific protection capabilities or shielded locations (e.g., to protect keys).\r\n```",

First take a look at the definitions for ATTRIBUTE and EXTENSION:\r\n```\r\n  ATTRIBUTE ::= CLASS {\r\n      &id             OBJECT IDENTIFIER UNIQUE,\r\n      &Type           OPTIONAL,\r\n      &equality-match MATCHING-RULE OPTIONAL,\r\n      &minCount       INTEGER DEFAULT 1,\r\n      &maxCount       INTEGER OPTIONAL\r\n  } WITH SYNTAX {\r\n      [TYPE &Type]\r\n      [EQUALITY MATCHING RULE &equality-match]\r\n      [COUNTS [MIN &minCount] [MAX &maxCount]]\r\n      IDENTIFIED BY &id\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  EXTENSION ::= CLASS {\r\n      &id  OBJECT IDENTIFIER UNIQUE,\r\n      &ExtnType,\r\n      &Critical    BOOLEAN DEFAULT {TRUE | FALSE }\r\n  } WITH SYNTAX {\r\n      SYNTAX &ExtnType IDENTIFIED BY &id\r\n      [CRITICALITY &Critical]\r\n  }\r\n ```\r\nNotice ATTRIBUTE uses TYPE and EXTENSION uses SYNTAX. You are using TYPE for both. So change the definitions of ext-evidence and ext-evidenceCerts to use SYNTAX. Also, remove the unnecessary commas from the definitions. There also is no COUNTS field in EXTENSION. Thus:\r\n```\r\next-evidence EXTENSION ::= {\r\n  SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle\r\n  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement\r\n}\r\n\r\next-evidenceCerts EXTENSION ::= {\r\n  SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF CertificateChoice\r\n  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceChainCerts\r\n}\r\n\r\nattr-evidence ATTRIBUTE ::= {\r\n  TYPE SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle\r\n  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement\r\n}\r\n\r\nattr-evidenceCerts ATTRIBUTE ::= {\r\n  TYPE SEQUENCE OF CertificateChoice\r\n  COUNTS MAX 1\r\n  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceChainCerts\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI got a compilation error on the Evidence Statement definition and changed it to be this (but wasn't really sure what you were aiming for so this may warrant further investigation):\r\n```\r\nEvidenceStatement ::= SEQUENCE {\r\n   type   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&id({EvidenceStatementSet}),\r\n   stmt   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&Type({EvidenceStatementSet}{@type})\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI also had to define id-aa and id-pkix in the module. The former because I did not have the referenced module lying around and the latter because id-pkix is not defined in the indicated module. It's actually in PKIX1Explicit-2009, not PKIX-CommonTypes-2009.\r\n\r\nOther changes I made to get it to compile:\r\n\r\n- used fake values for the OIDs (used 9991, 9992 and 9993 for the three TBDs)\r\n- dropped the symbolic name from the leaf element in the OID definitions, i.e., id-aa-evidenceChainCerts OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aa 9993 }\r\n\r\nI will send you the module I test compiled successfully.\r\n",

          "body": "Comments:\r\n\r\n1.\r\nIn the aasvg, you have \"1..n EvidenceBundle\", \"0..n CertificateAlternatives\", and \"1..n EvidenceStatement\".\r\nI agree that's how I also imagine this being user,d but technically they are all declared as SEQUENCE, so are all 0..n. \r\nFor example, if your Evidence is already an X.509 certificate then you could conceivably put that in the SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives and leave the SEQUENCE OF EvidenceStatement empty. I'm not sure that's a good idea, but it is allowed under the current definitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\nI think we should add a usecase that deals with Endorsements. This is related to #63. \r\nPossibly just modify the wording of #3 to \"... multiple Attesters or Endorsers\", and \"... Evidence or Endorsement statements\".\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\nI think there are actually two valid ways of addressing #4: the one you describe where a Verifier has to look across EvidenceBundles in order to find the complete cert chains that it needs, or merging all of those into a single EvidenceBundle with a single de-duplicated SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives; that would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n +-------------------------+\r\n |  EvidenceBundle         |\r\n +-------------------------+\r\n | EvidenceStatements {     |\r\n |   EvidenceStatement (1)  |\r\n |   ...                     |\r\n |  EvidenceStatement (n)  |\r\n | }                         |\r\n | CertificateAlternatives { |\r\n |  EndEntity (1)          |\r\n |  ...                     |\r\n |  EndEntity (n)            |\r\n | <remainder of           |\r\n |     certificate chain >     |\r\n | }                   |\r\n +-------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could call what you wrote 4a, and this 4b. 4a helps the verifier by providing 1-to-1 mapping between EvidenceStatements and the EndEntity certificate to verify it, but makes the Relying Party implementation more complicated, for example by needing to re-assemble complete certificate chains across EvidenceBundles if the Verifier needs to be invoked separately for each EvidenceStatement.\r\nWhereas 4b means that each EvidenceBundle is self-contained and any EvidenceStatement can be verified using only the SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives in its bundle, but Verifiers will have to do proper certificate path building since the SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives is now a cert bag and not a cert chain.\r\nPros and Cons to both.",

I was reading through and got a bit confused by this line, specifically by `the EK is used by an Attestation CA to create an Attestation Key`. My understanding was that the EK is used to assure a 3rd party (in this case the Privacy CA / Attestation CA) that the AK is in the same TPM as the EK, not for the CA to issue the AK. Am I getting this wrong?",

The Attestation CA is just a special CA that uses the TPM protocols (including the EK) to prove the AK is in the same TPM (and has the expected attributes). The Attestation CA then issues a certificate for the AK. Since the AK is a signing key (the EK is a decryption key so the protocol is a bit awkward and non-standard - again, this is one of the reasons we use the term Attestation CA because it acts as a non-standard CA) it is easier to get a signed statement about the properties of a \"user key\". Defining that signed statement is the point of this effort.",

I thought that would make it easier for someone to find it if they were reading the spec. The previous comment uses upper case as if to say the CMW structure can be found in the TCG spec by that name. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, the Description section should contain free form prose?",

Maybe steal some verbiage from the CAB Forum guidelines and say: \"Regulatory bodies are beginning to require proof that keys are generated in a non\u2010exportable way using a suitable Hardware Crypto Module.\"\r\n\r\nI am going to leave this one as-is. I think that \"proof of hardware residency\" is not incorrect, and is made more precise in the following sentence, including the direct quote from the CA/B CSBRs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> The last paragraph leaves open the possibility of having multiple instantiations of attr-evidence or ext-evidence but does not mention the fact that the values field in Attribute can contain multiple values. Do we really need three ways to convey multiple evidence bundles, i.e., via EvidenceBundles, via multiple attributes, via multiple attribute values? Is there any reason to not just limit this to one attribute/extension, one value within attribute and let EvidenceBundles handle collections?\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, good point.\r\nI have attempted to strengthen this, but I would love review of the new paragraph. Have I correctly understood and referenced the AttributeSet and ExtensionSet stuff from RFC5912? Is there a better way to enforce this through the ASN.1 definitions?\r\n\r\n> Section 5.3 CertificateAlternatives\r\n\r\nGiven the on-list discussion, and that we have subsequently fully removed the CertificateAlternatives section, I am going to mostly skip over this feedback as no longer relevant.\r\n\r\n> Section 5.3\r\n> - Given the use of Verifier throughout, if enforcement of RFC5280 compliance is to be addressed by this spec, perhaps it should be allocated to the verifier instead of the relying party.\r\n\r\nI don't understand this comment at all? What are we enforcing for 5280 compliance? The CSR? -- I am imagining that the Verifier won't get to see the full CSR, just the evidence blob that has been forklifted out of it.\r\n\r\n> Section 7.1\r\n> - Either add a reference to draft-birkholz-rats-epoch-markers in support of` \"Epochs also require\" or delete that sentence. The section is fine without the reference to Epochs.\r\n\r\nSo, this sentence is going through RATS Architecture [RFC9334} sections 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3, and saying why each is not a general solution here. I generified the sentence a bit so that it fits better within the scope of RFC9334 10.3.\r\n\r\n> Section 7.2\r\n> - The NOT RECOMMENDED here is inconsistent with the MUST NOT in section 5.2. NOT RECOMMENDED seems right.\r\n> - Given the words throughout about not using the extension type in a certificate, ought there be some words about not using the attribute type in a subject directory attributes extension in a certificate?\r\n\r\nThese are excellent points. I have opened a separate pull request (#138) so that they can be discussed separately.\r\n\r\n> Section 7.3\r\n> - How does the last sentence of this section apply to this draft, i.e., where could one express \"None, Null, Debug, empty CMW contents, or similar values\"?\r\n\r\nI see your point, but I think I'm going to leave it; I think it reads ok. Could you please read it again and see if you still feel strongly about that sentence?\r\n\r\n> Section B.1\r\n> - This should probably be presented as a standalone ASN.1 module that adds this definition instead of as a snip from an ASN.1 module.\r\n\r\nI will discuss with @nedmsmith .",

But if the I-D specifies expected use, then it seems the intended usage is that of an identifier (and nothing more). Hence, it is useful as a key for searching a list but not as an address that could invoke network services that might exist outside of an administrative domain or require network connectivity (assuming the list is local). The I-D didn\u2019t want to specify the type of identifier, just let the application developer choose.\r\n\r\nHence, something generic like byte string or text string seems good enough.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNed\r\n\r\nFrom: A.J.

An\r\n\r\n+Attester MAY include the hint to the EvidenceStatement and it MAY be processed\r\n\r\n+by the Relying Party. The Relying Party MAY decide not to trust the information\r\n\r\n+embedded in the hint or policy MAY override any information provided by the Attester\r\n\r\n+via this hint.\r\n\r\n+\r\n\r\n+When the Attester populates the hint, it MUST contain a fully qualified domain\r\n\r\n+name (FQDN) which uniquely identifies a Verifier.\r\n\r\nNit - RFC6125 was obsoleted by RFC9525. It seems odd to reference this RFC (on TLS service identity) for a value that is not intended to be de-referenced.\r\n\r\nI do not disagree, I could not really find the right reference to explain what FQDN is or is not without other necessary context, but I thought per the title, \"Representation and Verification of Domain-Based Application Service\r\nIdentity within Internet Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509,\" aside from the TLS identity context. Are you suggesting a reference to RFC1034 is more suitable? Ironically 1034 does not reference the term FQDN, it seems to evolved from fully qualified address, total, or absolute domain. FQDN is not defined, so I thought it would be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nIf RFC1034 is not helpful, is there another you would recommend?\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/lamps-wg/csr-attestation/pull/143#discussion_r1662520148>, or unsubscribe<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABPMCSGN3QISG6MMDUAYFZTZKKTCTAVCNFSM6AAAAABKFFQR5OVHI2DSMVQWIX3LMV43YUDVNRWFEZLROVSXG5CSMV3GSZLXHMZDCNJTHAYTGNBXHE>.\r\nYou are receiving this because you commented.Message ID: ***@***.***>\r\n",

It is assumed that the RP must be pre-configured with a list of trusted Verifiers and that the contents of this hint can be used to look up the correct Verifier. Under no circumstances must the RP be tricked into contacting an unknown and untrusted Verifier since the returned Attestation Result must not be relied on.\r\n\r\nNed's comment above seems to be coming full circle to the original (current) text.\r\n\r\nThe review feedback was that this is too loose, and instead of \"UTF8String _such as_\", we should make it more precise: \"UTF8String which MUST be {something}\", but we can't agree on what that {something} should be. A valid outcome is to put back the original text. I personally think it is already clear enough.",

Are you suggesting a reference to RFC1034 is more suitable? Ironically 1034 does not reference the term FQDN, it seems to evolved from fully qualified address, total, or absolute domain.

Could you explain?\r\n\r\nI had not created a sample realm claim set yet, and this issue was pending for a while so I wanted to get something in for review.  I can add a realm token example.\r\n\r\nOne more question:  will a single OID be allocated for CCA token?  Or can different OID's be assigned for the different CCA attestation options?  I think t least for CSR's there could potentially be three:  (a) Platform token only, (b) DIrect model:  Platform token + realm claims set, where a hash of the realm claims set is included in the platform token payload as challenge data, and (c) Delegated model:  Platform token + Realm Attestation Token, where Platform token includes the Realm Attestation PubKey as challenge data.  Another option is to just assign one OID for CCA, and have the variants be identified by CBOR tags.",

I have not seen anyone referring to the Attestation Key as an Endorsement. The RATS architecture RFC is, however, unclear on the use of the CA certificate that is the root of the chain of the AK certificate. Figure 1 in RFC 9334, for example, does not mention these Trust Anchors, which obviously need to be provisioned to the Verifier to have a working solution.",
