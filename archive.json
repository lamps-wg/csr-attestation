The core question here is whether LAMPS / CSR should be specifying encodings other than ASN.1.\r\n\r\nWhat is the rationale for redefining something that is already defined but doesn't use ASN.1 as the data definition language?\r\n\r\nI makes sense to consider the constraints of the environments that are creating the CSR structures and their capabilities. HSMs that already support ASN.1/DER likely will object to some other encoding (e.g., CBOR), but environments that are already capable of CBOR may object to ASN.1/DER etc. Given there are use cases for CSRs originating from various environments such as DICE Protection Environment (DPE), SPDM Responders, and embedded uControllers (but not HSMs). Given there can be layers of compute that may issue a CSR, the CSR draft should be flexible toward accommodating industry evolution and trends rather than serve to constrain or limit such evolution.",

In complex scenarios (such as Composite Devices) the sequence construct allows multiple Evidence payloads to be conveyed in a CSR. In such a situation it is possible to convey a certificate chain with each Evidence payload.\r\n\r\nThe payload construction would be something like:\r\n\r\n               Evidence1\r\n               cert1\r\n               Evidence2\r\n               cert2\r\n\r\nWe have also envisioned the case where the certificate chain is the same for all Evidence payloads.

In his scenario multiple Evidence payloads are sent and their certificate chain only differents by the end entity certificate. In the current design an optimization would not be possible.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Should we allow this optimization? If so, how should we best design it?\r\n",

          "body": "This was discussed over breakfast at 118.\r\n\r\nOut of that discussion we have two changes to make to the document:\r\n\r\n1)\r\nAdd a MUST statement in the EvidenceBundle definition section, something like:\r\n\r\n> All of the EvidenceStatements within a given EvidenceBundle MUST be verifiable with the certificates contained within that EvidenceBundle, or with certificates already known to the verifier. Specifically, verifiers MUST NOT be forced to search the certificates contained in a different EvidenceBundle; if multiple EvidenceBundles require the same certificate(s) in order to verify their EvidenceStatements, then those certificates MUST be duplicated into all EvidenceBundle that requires them.\r\n\r\n\r\n2)\r\nAdd an Implementation Consideration with a worked example of \"the slider\".\r\n\r\n> Section X\r\nProvide an example with:\r\n[EvidenceStatement1] signed by [ [SigningCert1], [DeviceRootCert], [ManufacturerRootCert] ]\r\n[EvidenceStatement2] signed by [ [SigningCert2], [DeviceRootCert], [ManufacturerRootCert] ]\r\nwhere the [DeviceRootCert] and [ManufacturerRootCert] are common to the two evidence statements. This specification provides multiple ways to encode this scenario with the goals of allowing implementers to choose whether they wish to optimize for bandwidth by including a minimal and de-duplicated certificate bundle), or to optimize for computation by providing one-to-one associations of EvidenceStatements and the certificate chains that validate them.\r\n\r\n> Section X.1: Bandwidth-optimized encoding\r\nIf the implementer wishes to optimize for bandwidth, then the CSR producer MAY merge these two certificate chains into a single EvidenceBundle:\r\n```\r\nattr-evidence ATTRIBUTE ::= {\r\n  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement\r\n  SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle {\r\n    EvidenceBundle ::= SEQUENCE\r\n    {\r\n      evidence  SEQUENCE OF EvidenceStatement {\r\n         [EvidenceStatement1], [EvidenceStatement2]\r\n      }\r\n      certs SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives {\r\n         [SigningCert1], [SigningCert2], [DeviceRootCert], [ManufacturerRootCert]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote that bandwidth optimization in this way forces extra computation on the validator (certificate path building) since the certs is not a single ordered certificate chain.\r\n\r\n> Section X.2: Computation-optimized encoding\r\nThis example can equivalently be encoded as two independent EvidenceBundles:\r\n```\r\n\r\nattr-evidence ATTRIBUTE ::= {\r\n  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement\r\n  SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle {\r\n    EvidenceBundle ::= SEQUENCE\r\n    {\r\n      evidence  SEQUENCE OF EvidenceStatement {\r\n         [EvidenceStatement1]\r\n      }\r\n      certs SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives {\r\n         [SigningCert1], [DeviceRootCert], [ManufacturerRootCert]\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    EvidenceBundle ::= SEQUENCE\r\n    {\r\n      evidence  SEQUENCE OF EvidenceStatement {\r\n         [EvidenceStatement2]\r\n      }\r\n      certs SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives {\r\n         [SigningCert2], [DeviceRootCert], [ManufacturerRootCert]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis encoding optimizes for computation in a couple of different ways. First, the CSR producer does not need to merge and de-duplicate the two certificate chains, in fact this encoding could allow the CSR producer to opaquely copy the evidence statements and cert chains without needing to parse them. Second, the verifier does not need to do any complex certificate path building because each evidence statement is bundled one-to-one with the certificate chain against which it can be validated.",

      "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nPlease find my review of the document. Mostly hints except for freshness that I think we need to require or recommend a bit stronger. \r\n\r\nYours, \r\nDaniel \r\n\r\n2 Intro:\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nAt the time of writing, several standard and several proprietary attestation technologies are in use. This specification thereby is intended to be as technology-agnostic as it is feasible with respect to implemented remote attestation technologies. Instead, it focuses on (1) the conveyance of Evidence via CSRs while making minimal assumptions about content or format of the transported Evidence and (2) the conveyance of sets of certificates used for validation of Evidence. The certificates typically contain one or more certification paths rooted in a device manufacture trust anchor and the leaf certificate being on the device in question; the latter is the Attestation Key that signs the Evidence statement. \r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nI would probably add at the end of the paragraph: \r\nEvidences are carried in a Attribute designated as EvidenceStatements, certificates are carried in a CertificateAlternatives. EvidenceStatements and CertificateAlternatives are grouped into EvidenceBundles. \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nThis document specifies two ATTRIBUTE/Attribute definitions. \r\n\"\"\r\n\r\nWe do not really know if one is designated ATTRIBUTE while the other Attribute or if some call these two attributes ATTRIBUTES while other call them Attributes.\r\nIn my opinion, it would be clearer to name directly the Attributes CertificateAlternatives EvidenceStatements.\r\nI would propose the following text:\r\n\r\nThis document specifies two Attributes. The first Attribute is CertificateAlternatives that may be used to carry a set of certificates or public keys that may be required to validate signed Evidence. The second Attribute is  EvidenceStatements that carries a structure that may be used to convey Evidence. These two Attributes combined into a \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nWith these attributes, additional information about whether to issue a certificate and what information to populate into the certificate is available to an RA or CA.\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nI am reading that the content of the evidence will determine the information of in the issued certificate. I THINK these Evidence will determine the issuance of the certificate if they are matching a policy and information provided is determined by policies. In my my opinion we should limit the scope to the policy.    \r\n \r\nThe scope of this document is, however, limited to the conveyance of Evidence within CSR. The exact format of the Evidence being conveyed is defined in various standard and proprietary specifications.\r\n\r\n3 Architecture\r\n\r\n<mglt> \r\nI tend to think we should indicate the CA/RA on the figure, potentially the HSM.\r\n</mglt>\r\n\r\n\r\n4.1 Intercation with an HSM\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nAs discussed in RFC 9334, different security and privacy aspects need to be considered. \r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nI think we should say why. I would for example add:\r\nAs discussed in RFC 9334, different security and privacy aspects need to be considered to enforce trust in the Evidence.\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nFinally, the keying material used by the Attester need to be protected against unauthorized access, and against signing arbitrary content that originated from outside the device.\r\n\"\"\"\r\nTo me that seems to be the primary thing to be listed ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\nFig 2 I like OpenSSL and I think it should remain but probably as an example. \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\n the generates and embeds Evidence and the corresponding certificate chains when constructing the CSR.\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nI suspect \"HSM\" is missing I propose:\r\nThe HSM generates and embeds....\r\n\r\nFig 2: I think HSM here is composed of the attestation environment and the service. getEvidence is addressed to the platform sign to the service. I am wondering if we should split these two. Note that I see the service as \"Software\" so maybe I am biassed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nExternally-generated CSRs may require extra round-trips of communication between the CSR generator and the attesting environment, first to obtain the necessary evidence statements about the subject key, and then to use the subject key to sign the CSR. For example, consider a CSR generated by a popular crypto library about a subject key stored on a PKCS#11 [PKCS11] device. \r\n\"\"\"\r\nShould we replace \"evidence statements\" by Evidence ? I do not think that popular is necessary, mentioning \"(like OpenSSL): might be helpful. I know it used to be on the figure.    \r\n4.2. Implementation Strategies\r\n\r\nFig 3 :  the meaning of 0,n are  bit enigmatic to me. In particular I am wondering if inverting 0 and n would change the meaning. I interpret it as meaning between 0 - n. If that is the case, the text mentions one to many, so maybe that needs some clarifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe we could mention  that CertificateAlternatives represents various format of certificates I propose to complement the last sentence of the paragraph to:\r\nEach EvidenceBundle contains one or multiple EvidenceStatement structures as well as one or many CertificateAlternatives which enable to carry various format of certificates. \r\n\r\n \r\n\"\"\"\r\nSingle Attester, which only distributes Evidence without any certificate chains, i.e. the Verifier is assumed to be in possession of the certificate chain already or there is no certificate chain.  \r\n\"\"\"\r\nI think what the last sentence is saying is the say the statements are not signed. \r\nIf so, \"or there is no certificate chain.\" should be replaced by \"or statements ar enot signed.\"\r\n\r\n \r\n\"\"\"\r\nIt may be possible that there is an overlap in the certificate chains transmitted by the different Attesters. \r\n\"\"\"\r\nI think we can be more specific and say: \r\nThis may result in certificates being duplicated across multiple EvidenceBundles.\r\n\r\nImplementation strategies to order certificates are only useful if they can be used, so I suspect we should provide some requirements such as the strategies described here MUST be supported and Certificates MUST be ordered from leaf to top. We should also  specify whether the root CA needs to be placed probably a SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT. A verifier SHOULD NOT make any assumption.... \r\n\r\n\r\n5.2 Evidence Attribute and Extension\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nThe hint is intended for an Attester to indicate to the Relying Party which Verifier should be invoked to parse this statement. \r\n\"\"\"\r\nWe need to specify that RP will designate later the Relaying party. I propose to change \"Relying Party\" to \"Relying Party (RP)\"\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nIn many cases, the type OID will already uniquely indicate which Verifier to invoke, but in some cases it may still be ambiguous, or the type may indicate another layer of conceptual message wrapping in which case it is helpful to the RP to bring this hint outside of the statement. \r\n\"\"\"\r\nI think we need to explicitly mention why the OID will indicate the Verifier. I suspect the reasoning is that OID will be vendor specific and Verifier will be vendor specific as well. I expect that verifier will be also configured by the client and as such who will send the CSR but such authentication will be made outside the scope of the CSR.\r\nI understand that hint indicates the Verifier. Do we expect the hint to be something like a FQDN ? \r\nOne thing one need to consider is that I have the impression the hint cannot be trusted unless the CSR is generated by the attesting environment.  If that is correct, we probably need to be cautious regarding that hint and mention it in the security considerations. \r\n\r\n\r\nI do not clearly see what id-ata represents. I have the impression this is the arc under which all Evidence Statement will be registered. id-ata.1, id-ata.2, ... will represent evidence statements. This specific evidence statements are represented by the EvidenceStatementSet structure.\r\n\r\nI am reading that id-aa-evidenceStatement represents EvidenceBundles. If so I am wondering why do not we call it id-aa-evidenceBundles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following text is quite obscure to me:\r\n\"\"\"\r\nWe are leaving the SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle since it is in general more flexible than relying on the containing structure to handle multiplicity and allows for this structure to be re-used in the future in other PKIX protocol contexts.\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\n7: Security Consideration\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nA PKCS#10 or CRMF Certification Request message consists of a distinguished name, a public key, and optionally a set of attributes, collectively signed by the entity requesting certification. \r\n\"\"\"\r\nWell with DN being the certificate Subject I think it can be empty. I woudl propose to replace distinguished name by an identity or identifier. \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nThe private key used to sign the CSR MUST be different from the Attesting Key utilized to sign Evidence about the Target Environment. \r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nThis seems correct - at least in general -, but I am questioning we never never never have a case where a root CA requests a CSR... \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nKey separation is an important principle in cryptography and also applies to this specification with regards to the Attestation Key and the CSR signing key.\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nI do not really understand the sentence, CSR the key is signing the CSR prove the ownership of the key for which a certificate is issued. Evidences are signed to authenticate thetrust of the evidences. I guess I am missing something here.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nFor example, one implementation may perform a software measurement of the CSR library along with the crypto library implementation that has access to the keying material.\r\n\"\"\"\r\nI am reading software measurement as the CSR being a target environment.  \r\nIf the CSR library is outside the attesting environment, it is unclear to me how it can be attested unless we are in a multi attester use case. \r\n\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\nNone of these things are practical when interacting with Hardware Security Modules (HSM).\r\n\"\"\"\r\nI think I disagree here and we need to have freshness or at least some lifetime for Evidences. TLS or ACME  are ways to provide a nonce that needs to be considered during the attestation. We should strongly recommend to implement freshness. It is correct that freshness can be implemented in various ways, including a simple serial number. The threat model seems simple, the key is generated on a HSM, the crypto becomes weak, I can generate the key on my raspberry pie, the CSR can be used for that key - while all certificate have expired. CSR are not necessarily encrypted.   \r\n",

This section is meant to be examples / informative. I think that if we try to make this section normative, then we will get into trouble.\r\n\r\nIn general, we are providing containers and want to leave room for an Attester and Verifier from the same vendor to use these structures however they want.\r\n\r\nIn particular, if we say anything about mandatory certificate order, then we make it hard for cases where we want to include multiple cert chains, or multiple partial cert chains in a single EvidenceBundle. We decided at a meeting that things like P12 files already require certificate parsing clients to be able to handle bags of certificates in arbitrary order that may contain extra certs not needed for a specific Leaf -> CA path, so it is fair to also expect this of Verifiers. If a given vendor's Verifier cannot do this, then they should construct their Evidence accordingly, but I do not think that the specification should arbitrarily restrict those of us with proper certificate path building logic :)\r\n\r\nSimilar reasoning for whether the Root should be placed or not. For example, in complex cross-certified or bridged PKIs it is possible that a self-signed root certificate is not in your trust store, but it is cross-signed as a subordinate of a root that is. So in that case the Attester would need to include the root cert in the EvidenceBundle.\r\n\r\nI think that making any restrictions here on what may be in the certificate list will make it impossible to transmit certain complex PKIs, only for the benefit of simple PKIs that do not implement 5280 path-building properly :)",

How the CA does that is up to the CA with Attestation being one of the acceptable methods; various signed letters and screenshots of admin consoles being another. So IF (Code_Signing); THEN hardware check must have been done.\r\n\r\nWe already had this text buried down in the Security Considerations.\r\n\r\n> The Code-Signing Baseline Requirements [CSBR] document is an example of such a policy that has been published by the CA Browser Forum and specifies certain properties, such as non-exportability, which must be enabled for storing publicly-trusted code-signing keys.

There needs to be a way to differentiate between body text and a title for the various cases and objects.     So a) split Figure 7 into two different figures, b) have a section on \"Case 4\" with subsections on \"Implementation Strategy 4a\" and \"Implementation Strategy 4b\" with the appropriate figures from Figure 7 within the section boundaries.  This is mostly editorial, but needs cleanup for figuring out which text paragraph belongs with which diagram.\r\n4.2 - How to encode\r\n4.2.1 - Case 1 - Single Evidence Bundle\r\n4.2.2 - Case 2 - Single Evidence Bundle with Certificates\r\n4.2.3 - Case 3 - Multiple Evidence Bundles each with complete Paths\r\n4.2.4 - Case 4 - Multiple Evidence Bundles with Certificate Transmission Optimization\r\n4.2.4.1 - Strategy 4a\r\n4.2.4.2 - Strategy 4b.\r\n\r\n3) Can Case 1 (where the validator is thought to know some of Case 1's certificates) be encoded as part of Case 4?  I.e., is it legal to have an EvidenceBundle with no certificates as part of any of Case 4?  Or for that matter Case 3?  \r\n4) What knowledge must a \"Leader Attester\" have to select between each of the cases for encoding?   I.e., pre-configured?, some policy object they got?  Specific guidance from each of the possible validators each wanting the same data formatted in a specific way to make their lives easier?\r\n5) Must a validator that can handle Case 3, must also be able to go looking for certs in other bundles if the chain for a given bundle can't be built for validation?  Or must that be treated as a non-validation error by the validator?\r\n6) May a 4B output contain multiple EvidenceBundles each looking like 4B but with a partially disjoint set of certificates?  The description for 4b looks more like case 3 than a special case of 4.\r\n7) May you mix and match the various cases?  And must a Validator be required to riffle through all the various bundles to find the right mix of certificates to validate a given evidence statement?\r\nText needs to be written to cover answers for each of these I believe.\r\n8) Evidence Hint appears to be a way to convey type data that's otherwise buried inside of an Evidence Object of identical top-level types.  This seems to be laziness to not require different OIDs for different pseudo-wrapped and typed evidence statements from DICE ConceptualMessageWrapper (the example, but also handwaving other possibilities).  Recommend elimination of this and putting the onus on the post-processing software to do the differentiation if the proponents of these types of objects don't want to request multiple OIDs.  I don't find the arguments for inclusion convincing.  \r\n9) The TPM example needs work, A2.3\r\n9a)  \r\nThe structure here needs to be de-OCTET STRING'd.\r\nE.g. \r\nTpmV2Attest ::= OCTET STRING -- This is formatted as the encoding of <tpmv2 structures, TPMS_ATTEST>.  \r\n                                                        -- This may be any of the valid attestation structures. For a signature over a public key, only a hash of related public key data is included under the signature.\r\nTpm2InternalSig ::= OCTET STRING -- This is formatted as the encoding of <tpmv2 structures TPMT_SIGNATURE>.  This structure includes the type of signature as well as the actual signature bytes/bits \r\nTpm2Public ::= OCTET STRING -- This is formatted as <tpmv2 structures TPMT_PUBLIC>.  This structure includes the type of key as well as the key bytes.  This is the key being signed.\r\n\r\nTcg-csr-certify ::= SEQUENCE {\r\n   tpmSAttest ::= TpmV2Attest,\r\n   tpmSignature :: = Tpm2InternalSig, -- This is the signature returned by a call to TPM2_Certify over the tpmSAttest object.\r\n   tpmTPublic ::= Tpm2Public OPTIONAL -- This is REQUIRED if the attestation is over a public key  (e.g. if TPMS_ATTEST.type == ???) as it's the only way to map from the key being attested to the attestation.\r\n}\r\n9b) tcg-kp-AIKCertificateField????   This is an extended key purpose OID.  There is no field that contains the AIK certificate.  \r\n9c) A2.5.1 - the TPMU_ATTEST field is a Union identified by .type.  The TPMS_CERTIFY_INFO is union value of what's certified for a public key\r\n9d) If you've got TPMU_ATTEST, you need to explain how to get from Tpm2Public (TPMT_PUBLIC) to the value of the attested field.\r\n9e) Sample CSR - how does the lead attester know what software is installed on the validator's side (e.g. package tpmverifier.example.com)?   This implies there needs to be a registry mapping \"hints\" to something global.  In any event, if you have the OID and you have the structure definitions pointed to that OID, then the Hint is extraneous.  If the validator has multiple ways of resolving a TPMv2 attestation, they're doing it wrong.  Repeat my recommendation to remove hints.\r\n10) Should additional CMS error codes be added for this new extension?  E.g. RFC5272, section 6.1.1 - ExtendedFailInfo.  I don't see how CMCStatus or CMCFailInfo can be extended to cover the possible chaining errors and evidence/validator mismatches.  Ditto for CMP?\r\nLater, Mike\r\n",

          "body": "There are a few issues. First take a look at the definitions for ATTRIBUTE and EXTENSION:\r\n```\r\n  ATTRIBUTE ::= CLASS {\r\n      &id             OBJECT IDENTIFIER UNIQUE,\r\n      &Type           OPTIONAL,\r\n      &equality-match MATCHING-RULE OPTIONAL,\r\n      &minCount       INTEGER DEFAULT 1,\r\n      &maxCount       INTEGER OPTIONAL\r\n  } WITH SYNTAX {\r\n      [TYPE &Type]\r\n      [EQUALITY MATCHING RULE &equality-match]\r\n      [COUNTS [MIN &minCount] [MAX &maxCount]]\r\n      IDENTIFIED BY &id\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  EXTENSION ::= CLASS {\r\n      &id  OBJECT IDENTIFIER UNIQUE,\r\n      &ExtnType,\r\n      &Critical    BOOLEAN DEFAULT {TRUE | FALSE }\r\n  } WITH SYNTAX {\r\n      SYNTAX &ExtnType IDENTIFIED BY &id\r\n      [CRITICALITY &Critical]\r\n  }\r\n ```\r\nNotice ATTRIBUTE uses TYPE and EXTENSION uses SYNTAX. You are using TYPE for both. So change the definitions of ext-evidence and ext-evidenceCerts to use SYNTAX. Also, remove the unnecessary commas from the definitions. There also is no COUNTS field in EXTENSION. Thus:\r\n```\r\next-evidence EXTENSION ::= {\r\n  SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle\r\n  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement\r\n}\r\n\r\next-evidenceCerts EXTENSION ::= {\r\n  SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF CertificateChoice\r\n  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceChainCerts\r\n}\r\n\r\nattr-evidence ATTRIBUTE ::= {\r\n  TYPE SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle\r\n  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement\r\n}\r\n\r\nattr-evidenceCerts ATTRIBUTE ::= {\r\n  TYPE SEQUENCE OF CertificateChoice\r\n  COUNTS MAX 1\r\n  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceChainCerts\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI got a compilation error on the Evidence Statement definition and changed it to be this (but wasn't really sure what you were aiming for so this may warrant further investigation):\r\n```\r\nEvidenceStatement ::= SEQUENCE {\r\n   type   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&id({EvidenceStatementSet}),\r\n   stmt   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&Type({EvidenceStatementSet}{@type})\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI also had to define id-aa and id-pkix in the module. The former because I did not have the referenced module lying around and the latter because id-pkix is not defined in the indicated module. It's actually in PKIX1Explicit-2009, not PKIX-CommonTypes-2009.\r\n\r\nOther changes I made to get it to compile:\r\n\r\n- used fake values for the OIDs (used 9991, 9992 and 9993 for the three TBDs)\r\n- dropped the symbolic name from the leaf element in the OID definitions, i.e., id-aa-evidenceChainCerts OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aa 9993 }\r\n\r\nI will send you the module I test compiled successfully.\r\n",

          "body": "Comments:\r\n\r\n1.\r\nIn the aasvg, you have \"1..n EvidenceBundle\", \"0..n CertificateAlternatives\", and \"1..n EvidenceStatement\".\r\nI agree that's how I also imagine this being user,d but technically they are all declared as SEQUENCE, so are all 0..n. \r\nFor example, if your Evidence is already an X.509 certificate then you could conceivably put that in the SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives and leave the SEQUENCE OF EvidenceStatement empty. I'm not sure that's a good idea, but it is allowed under the current definitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\nI think we should add a usecase that deals with Endorsements. This is related to #63. \r\nPossibly just modify the wording of #3 to \"... multiple Attesters or Endorsers\", and \"... Evidence or Endorsement statements\".\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\nI think there are actually two valid ways of addressing #4: the one you describe where a Verifier has to look across EvidenceBundles in order to find the complete cert chains that it needs, or merging all of those into a single EvidenceBundle with a single de-duplicated SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives; that would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n +-------------------------+\r\n |  EvidenceBundle         |\r\n +-------------------------+\r\n | EvidenceStatements {     |\r\n |   EvidenceStatement (1)  |\r\n |   ...                     |\r\n |  EvidenceStatement (n)  |\r\n | }                         |\r\n | CertificateAlternatives { |\r\n |  EndEntity (1)          |\r\n |  ...                     |\r\n |  EndEntity (n)            |\r\n | <remainder of           |\r\n |     certificate chain >     |\r\n | }                   |\r\n +-------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could call what you wrote 4a, and this 4b. 4a helps the verifier by providing 1-to-1 mapping between EvidenceStatements and the EndEntity certificate to verify it, but makes the Relying Party implementation more complicated, for example by needing to re-assemble complete certificate chains across EvidenceBundles if the Verifier needs to be invoked separately for each EvidenceStatement.\r\nWhereas 4b means that each EvidenceBundle is self-contained and any EvidenceStatement can be verified using only the SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives in its bundle, but Verifiers will have to do proper certificate path building since the SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives is now a cert bag and not a cert chain.\r\nPros and Cons to both.",

The Attestation CA is just a special CA that uses the TPM protocols (including the EK) to prove the AK is in the same TPM (and has the expected attributes). The Attestation CA then issues a certificate for the AK. Since the AK is a signing key (the EK is a decryption key so the protocol is a bit awkward and non-standard - again, this is one of the reasons we use the term Attestation CA because it acts as a non-standard CA) it is easier to get a signed statement about the properties of a \"user key\".

The previous comment uses upper case as if to say the CMW structure can be found in the TCG spec by that name. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, the Description section should contain free form prose?",

Maybe steal some verbiage from the CAB Forum guidelines and say: \"Regulatory bodies are beginning to require proof that keys are generated in a non\u2010exportable way using a suitable Hardware Crypto Module.\"\r\n\r\nI am going to leave this one as-is. I think that \"proof of hardware residency\" is not incorrect, and is made more precise in the following sentence, including the direct quote from the CA/B CSBRs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> The last paragraph leaves open the possibility of having multiple instantiations of attr-evidence or ext-evidence but does not mention the fact that the values field in Attribute can contain multiple values. Do we really need three ways to convey multiple evidence bundles, i.e., via EvidenceBundles, via multiple attributes, via multiple attribute values? Is there any reason to not just limit this to one attribute/extension, one value within attribute and let EvidenceBundles handle collections?\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, good point.\r\nI have attempted to strengthen this, but I would love review of the new paragraph. Have I correctly understood and referenced the AttributeSet and ExtensionSet stuff from RFC5912? Is there a better way to enforce this through the ASN.1 definitions?\r\n",
