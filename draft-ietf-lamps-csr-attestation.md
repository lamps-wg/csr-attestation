--- abstract

A client requesting a certificate from a Certification Authority (CA) may wish to offer believable claims about the protections afforded to the corresponding private key, such as whether the private key resides on a hardware security module or the protection capabilities provided by the hardware.

This document describes how to encode Evidence produced by an Attester for inclusion in Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), and any certificates necessary for validating it.

Including Evidence along with a CSR can help to improve the assessment of the security posture for the private key, and the trustworthiness properties of the submitted key to the requested certificate profile. These Evidence Claims can include information about the hardware component's manufacturer, the version of installed or running firmware, the version of software installed or running in layers above the firmware, or the presence of hardware components providing specific protection capabilities or shielded locations (e.g., to protect keys).

# Introduction

When requesting a certificate from a Certification Authority (CA), a PKI end entity may wish to include Evidence of the security properties of its environments in which the private keys are stored in that request.
This Evidence can be appraised by authoritative entities, such as a Registration Authority (RA) or a CA, or associated trusted Verifiers as part of validating an incoming certificate request against given certificate policies.
This specification defines an attribute and an extension that allow for conveyance of Evidence in Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) in either PKCS#10 {{RFC2986}} or Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) {{RFC4211}} payloads.

As outlined in the RATS Architecture {{RFC9334}}, an Attester (typically
a device) produces a signed collection of Claims that constitutes Evidence about its running environment.
While the term "attestation" is not defined in RFC 9334, it was later defined in {{?I-D.ietf-rats-tpm-based-network-device-attest}}, it refers to the activity of producing and appraising remote attestation Evidence.
A Relying Party may consult an Attestation Result produced by a Verifier that has appraised the Evidence in making policy decisions about the trustworthiness of the
Target Environment being assessed via appraisal of Evidence. {{architecture}} provides the basis to illustrate in this document how the various roles
in the RATS architecture map to a certificate requester and a CA/RA.


At the time of writing, several standard and several proprietary attestation technologies
are in use.
This specification thereby is intended to be as technology-agnostic as it is feasible with respect to implemented remote attestation technologies. Instead, it focuses on (1) the conveyance of Evidence via CSRs while making minimal assumptions about content or format of the transported Evidence and (2) the conveyance of sets of certificates used for validation of Evidence.
The certificates typically contain one or more certification paths
rooted in a device manufacture trust anchor and the leaf certificate being
on the device in question; the latter is the Attestation Key that signs the Evidence statement.

This document specifies two ATTRIBUTE/Attribute definitions. The first
Attribute may be used to carry a set of certificates or public keys that
may be required to validate signed Evidence. The second Attribute carries a
structure that may be used to convey Evidence.

A CSR may contain one or more Evidence payloads, for example Evidence
asserting the storage properties of a private key as well Evidence
asserting firmware version and other general properties
of the device, or Evidence signed using different cryptographic
algorithms.

With these attributes, additional
information about whether to issue a certificate and what information
to populate into the certificate is available to an RA or CA. The scope of this document is, however,
limited to the conveyance of Evidence within CSR. The exact format of the
Evidence being conveyed is defined in various standard and proprietary
specifications.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document re-uses the terms defined in {{RFC9334}} related to remote
attestation. Readers of this document are assumed to be familiar with
the following terms: Evidence, Claim, Attestation Results (AR), Attester,
Verifier, Target Environment, Attesting Environment, and Relying Party (RP).

The term "Certification Request" message is defined in {{RFC2986}}.
Specifications, such as {{RFC7030}}, later introduced the term
"Certificate Signing Request (CSR)" to refer to the Certification
Request message. While the term "Certification Signing Request"
would have been correct, the mistake was unnoticed. In the meanwhile
CSR is an abbreviation used beyond PKCS#10. Hence, it is equally
applicable to other protocols that use a different syntax and
even a different encoding, in particular this document also
considers Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) {{RFC4211}}
to be "CSRs". We use the terms "CSR" and Certificate Request
message interchangeably.

# Architecture {#architecture}

{{fig-arch}} shows the high-level communication pattern of the RATS
background check model where the Attester transmits the Evidence in the
CSR to the RA and the CA, which is subsequently forwarded to the Verifier.
The Verifier appraises the received Evidence and computes an Attestation
Result, which is then processed by the RA/CA prior to the certificate
issuance.

In addition to the background check model the RATS architecture also
specifies the passport model and combinations. See Section 5.2 of
{{RFC9334}} for a description of the passport model. The passport model
requires the Attester to transmit Evidence to the Verifier directly in order
to obtain the Attestation Result, which is then forwarded to the Relying
Party. This specification utilizes the background model since CSRs are
often used as one-shot messages where no direct real-time interaction
between the Attester and the Verifier is possible.

Note that the Verifier is a logical role that may be included in the
RA/CA product. In this case the Relying Party and Verifier collapse into a
single entity. The Verifier functionality can, however,
also be kept separate from the RA/CA functionality, such as a utility or
library provided by the device manufacturer. For example,
security concerns may require parsers of Evidence formats to be logically
or physically separated from the core CA functionality.

{: #fig-arch title="Architecture with Background Check Model."}

As discussed in RFC 9334, different security and privacy aspects need to be
considered. For example, Evidence may need to be protected against replay and
Section 10 of RFC 9334 lists approach for offering freshness. There are also
concerns about the exposure of persistent identifiers by utilizing attestation
technology, which are discussed in Section 11 of RFC 9334. Finally, the keying
material used by the Attester need to be protected against unauthorized access,
and against signing arbitrary content that originated from outside the device.
This aspect is described in Section 12 of RFC 9334. Most of these aspects are,
however, outside the scope of this specification but relevant for use with a
given attestation technology. The focus of this specification is on the
transport of Evidence from the Attester to the Relying Party via existing
CSR messages.

# Information Model

## Interaction with an HSM

This specification is intended to be used both in cases where the CSR
is constructed internally or externally to the attesting environment.

Cases where the CSR is generated internally to the attesting environment
are straightforward: the generates and embeds Evidence and the corresponding
certificate chains when constructing the CSR.

Externally-generated CSRs may require extra round-trips of communication
between the CSR generator and the attesting environment, first to obtain
the necessary evidence statements about the subject key, and then to use
the subject key to sign the CSR. For example, consider a CSR generated by
a popular crypto library about a subject key stored on a PKCS#11 {{PKCS11}} device.

The interaction would conceptually be:

## Implementation Strategies

To support a number of different use cases for the transmission of
Evidence in a CSR (together with certificate chains) the structure
shown in {{fig-info-model}} is used.

On a high-level, the structure can be explained as follows:
A PKCS#10 attribute or a CRMF extension contains one or multiple
EvidenceBundle structures. Each EvidenceBundle contains one or
multiple EvidenceStatement structures as well as one or many
CertificateAlternatives.

~~~ aasvg
 +--------------------+
 |  PKCS#10 or CRMF   |
 |  Attribute or      |
 |  Extension         |
 +--------+-----------+
          |1
          |                     n +-------------------------+
          |         +-------------+ CertificateAlternatives |
          |         |             +-------------------------+
          |         |             | Certificate OR          |
          |         |             | TypedCert   OR          |
          |         |             | TypedFlatCert           |
          |         |             +-------------------------+

 +--------+---------+-+ 1       n +-------------------+
 |  EvidenceBundle    +-----------+ EvidenceStatement |

                                  | Type              |
                                  | Statement         |
                                  +-------------------+
~~~
{: #fig-info-model title="Information Model for CSR Evidence Conveyance."}

The following use cases are supported:

Single Attester, which only distributes Evidence without any certificate chains,
i.e. the Verifier is assumed to be in possession of the certificate chain already
or there is no certificate chain. As a result a single EvidenceBundle is included
in a CSR that contains a single EvidenceStatement without the CertificateAlternatives
structure. {{fig-single-attester}} shows this use case.

~~~
  +--------------------+
  |  EvidenceBundle    |
  +--------------------+
  | EvidenceStatement  |
  +--------------------+
~~~
{: #fig-single-attester title="Use Case 1: Single Attester without Certificate Chain."}


A single Attester, which shares Evidence together with a certificate chain.
The CSR conveys a single EvidenceBundle with a single EvidenceStatement
and a single CertificateAlternatives structure. {{fig-single-attester-with-chain}} shows
this use case.

~~~
 +-------------------------+
 |  EvidenceBundle         |
 +-------------------------+
 | EvidenceStatement       |
 | CertificateAlternatives |
 +-------------------------+
~~~
{: #fig-single-attester-with-chain title="Use Case 2: Single Attester with Certificate Chain."}


In a Composite Device, which contains multiple Attesters, a collection of Evidence
statements is obtained. Imagine that each Attester returns its Evidence together with a
certificate chain. As a result, multiple EvidenceBundle structures, each carrying
an EvidenceStatement and the corresponding CertificateAlternative structure with the
certificate chain as provided by each Attester, are included in the CSR. It may
be possible that there is an overlap in the certificate chains transmitted by
the different Attesters. This approach does not require any processing capabilities
by a lead Attester since the information is merely forwarded. {{fig-multiple-attesters}}
shows this use case.

~~~
  +-------------------------+
  |  EvidenceBundle (1)     |\
  +-------------------------+ \ Provided by
  | EvidenceStatement       | / Attester 1
  | CertificateAlternatives |/
  +-------------------------+
  |  EvidenceBundle (2)     |\
  +-------------------------+ \ Provided by
  | EvidenceStatement       | / Attester 2
  | CertificateAlternatives |/
  +-------------------------+
~~~
{: #fig-multiple-attesters title="Use Case 3: Multiple Attesters in Composite Device."}

In the last scenario, we also assume a Composite Device with additional processing
capabilities of the Leader Attester, which parses the certificate chains provided by
all Attesters in the device and removes redundant certificate information. The
benefit of this approach is the reduced transmission overhead. There are several
implementation strategies and we show two in {{fig-multiple-attesters-optimized}}.

~~~
Implementation strategy (4a)

                +-------------------------+
                |  EvidenceBundle (1)     |\
  Certificate   +-------------------------+ \ Provided by
  Chain +       | EvidenceStatement       | / Attester 1
  End-Entity -->| CertificateAlternatives |/

  End-Entity    | EvidenceStatement       | / Attester n
  Certificate-->| CertificateAlternatives |/
                +-------------------------+

 |        ...                   |
 | EvidenceStatement (n)        |
 | CertificateAlternatives {    |
 |   End Entity Certificate (1) |
 |        ...                   |
 |   End Entity Certificate (n) |
 |   <Remainder of the          |
 |    Certificate Chain>        |
 | }                            |
 +------------------------------+
~~~
{: #fig-multiple-attesters-optimized title="Use Case 4: Multiple Attesters in Composite Device (with Optimization)."}

In implementation strategy (4a) we assume that each Attester is provisioned with
a unique end-entity certificate. Hence, the certificate chains will at least differ
with respect to the end-entity certificates.
The Lead Attester will therefore create multiple EvidenceBundle structures, each
will carry an EvidenceStatement followed by a certificate chain in
the CertificateAlternative structures containing most likely only the end-entity
certificate. The shared certificate chain is carried in the first entry of the
EvidenceBundle sequence to allow path validation to take place immediately after
processing the first structure. This implementation strategy may
place extra burden on the Relying Party to parse EvidenceBundles and
reconstruct certificate chains if the Verifier requires each
EvidenceStatement to be accompanied with a complete certificate chain.

Implementation strategy (4b), as an alternative, requires the Lead Attester
to merge all certificate chains into a single EvidenceBundle containing a single
de-duplicated sequence of CertificateAlternatives structures. This means that each
EvidenceBundle is self-contained and any EvidenceStatement can be verified using
only the sequence of CertificateAlternatives in its bundle, but Verifiers will have
to do proper certification path building since the sequence of CertificateAlternatives
is now a cert bag and not a cert chain. This implementation strategy may
place extra burden on the Attester in order to allow the Relying Party
to treat the Evidence and Certificates as opaque content. It also may place
extra burden on the Verifier since this implementation strategy requires it to be able to
perform X.509 path building over a bag of certificates that may be out of
order or contain extraneous certificates.

Note: This specification does not mandate optimizing certificate chains since
there is a trade-off between the Attester implementation complexity and the
transmission overhead.

# ASN.1 Elements

##  Object Identifiers

We reference `id-pkix` and `id-aa`, both defined in {{!RFC5912}}.

We define:

~~~
-- Arc for Evidence types
id-ata OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix (TBD1) }
~~~


## Evidence Attribute and Extension

By definition, Attributes within a PKCS#10 CSR are
typed as ATTRIBUTE and within a CRMF CSR are typed as EXTENSION.
This attribute definition contains one or more
Evidence bundles of type `EvidenceBundle` which each contain
one or more Evidence statements of a type `EvidenceStatement` along with
an optional certificate chain.
This structure allows for grouping Evidence statements that share a
certificate chain.

~~~
EVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER

EvidenceStatementSet EVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= {
   ... -- None defined in this document --
}
~~~

This is a mapping and ASN.1 Types for Evidence Statements to the OIDs
that identify them. These mappings are are used to construct
or parse EvidenceStatements. These would typically be Evidence Statement
formats defined in other IETF standards, defined by other standards bodies,
or vendor proprietary formats along with the OIDs that identify them.

This list is left empty in this document. However, implementers should
populate it with the formats that they wish to support.

~~~
EvidenceStatements ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF EvidenceStatement

EvidenceStatement ::= SEQUENCE {
   type   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&id({EvidenceStatementSet}),
   stmt   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&Type({EvidenceStatementSet}{@type}),
   hint   GeneralName OPTIONAL
}
~~~

The type is on OID indicating the format of the data contained in stmt.

The hint is intended for an Attester to indicate to the Relying Party
which Verifier should be invoked to parse this statement. In many cases,
the type OID will already uniquely indicate which Verifier to invoke, but
in some cases it may still be ambiguous, or the type may indicate
another layer of conceptual message wrapping in which case it is helpful
to the RP to bring this hint outside of the statement.
It is assumed that the RP must be pre-configured with a list of trusted
Verifiers and that the contents of this hint can be used to look up
the correct Verifier. Under no circumstances must the RP be tricked into
contacting an unknown and untrusted Verifier since the returned Attestation
Result must not be relied on. The format and contents of the hint are out of
scope of this document.

~~~
EvidenceBundles ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF EvidenceBundle

EvidenceBundle ::= SEQUENCE
{
  evidence EvidenceStatements,
  certs SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF CertificateAlternatives OPTIONAL
}

id-aa-evidenceStatement OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aa TBDAA }

-- For PKCS#10
attr-evidence ATTRIBUTE ::= {
  TYPE EvidenceBundles
  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement
}

-- For CRMF
ext-evidence EXTENSION ::= {
  SYNTAX EvidenceBundles
  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement
}
~~~

The Extension variant is intended only for use within CRMF CSRs and MUST NOT be used within X.509 certificates due to the privacy implications of publishing Evidence about the end entity's hardware environment. See {{security-considerations}} for more discussion.

The `certs` contains a set of certificates that
may be needed to validate the contents of an Evidence statement
contained in `evidence`. The set of certificates should contain
the object that contains the public key needed to directly validate the
`evidence`.  The remaining elements should chain that data back to
an agreed upon trust anchor used for attestation. No order is implied, it is
up to the Attester and its Verifier to agree on both the order and format
of certificates contained in `certs`.

A CSR MAY contain one or more instances of `attr-evidence` or `ext-evidence`.
This means that the `SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle` is redundant with the
ability to carry multiple `attr-evidence` or `ext-evidence` at the CSR level;
either mechanism MAY be used for carrying multiple Evidence bundles.
We are leaving the `SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle` since it is in general
more flexible than relying on the containing structure to handle multiplicity
and allows for this structure to be re-used in the future in other PKIX
protocol contexts.


##  CertificateAlternatives

This is an ASN.1 CHOICE construct used to represent an encoding of a
broad variety of certificate types.

~~~
CertificateAlternatives ::=
   CHOICE {
      cert          [0] Certificate,
      typedCert     [1] TypedCert,
      typedFlatCert [2] TypedFlatCert,
      ...
   }
~~~

"Certificate" is a standard X.509 certificate that MUST be compliant
with RFC 5280.  Enforcement of this constraint is left to the relying
parties.

"TypedCert" is an ASN.1 construct that has the charateristics of a
certificate, but is not encoded as an X.509 certificate.  The
certType Field (below) indicates how to interpret the certBody field.  While
it is possible to carry any type of data in this structure, it's
intended the content field include data for at least one public key
formatted as a SubjectPublicKeyInfo (see {{RFC5912}}).

~~~
TYPED-CERT ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER

CertType ::= TYPED-CERT.&id

TypedCert ::= SEQUENCE {
              certType     TYPED-CERT.&id({TypedCertSet}),
              content     TYPED-CERT.&Type ({TypedCertSet}{@certType})
          }

TypedCertSet TYPED-CERT ::= {
   ... -- None defined in this document --
      }
~~~

"TypedFlatCert" is a certificate that does not have a valid ASN.1
encoding.
These are often compact or implicit certificates used by smart cards.
certType indicates the format of the data in the
certBody field, and ideally refers to a published specification.

~~~
TypedFlatCert ::= SEQUENCE {
    certType OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
    certBody OCTET STRING
}
~~~

## Attestation Evidence OID Registry

IANA is asked to create a registry that helps developers to find 
OID/Evidence mappings.

Registration requests are evaluated using the criteria described in
the registration template below after a three-week review period on
the [[TBD]] mailing list, on the advice of one or more Designated
Experts {{RFC8126}}.  However, to allow for the allocation of values
prior to publication, the Designated Experts may approve registration
once they are satisfied that such a specification will be published.

Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register attestation
evidence: example").

IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts
and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
list.

### Registration Template

The registry has the following columns:

- OID: The number of OID.

- Description: Brief description of the use of the Evidence and the
registration of the OID.
  
- Reference(s): Reference to the document or documents that register
the OID for use with a specific attestation technology, preferably
including URIs that can be used to retrieve copies of the documents.
An indication of the relevant sections may also be included but is not
required.

- Change Controller: For Standards Track RFCs, list the "IESG".  For
others, give the name of the responsible party.

### Initial Registry Contents

The initial registry contents is shown in the table below. It lists two
entries, one for DICE-based Evidence and the second for the Conceptual
Message Wrapper (CMW) {{I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap}}.

# Security Considerations

A PKCS#10 or CRMF Certification Request message consists of a
distinguished name, a public key, and optionally a set of attributes,
collectively signed by the entity requesting certification.
The private key used to sign the CSR MUST be different from the
Attesting Key utilized to sign Evidence about the Target
Environment. Key separation is an important principle in cryptography
and also applies to this specification with regards to the Attestation Key
and the CSR signing key. To demonstrate that the private
key applied to sign the CSR is generated, and stored in a secure
environment that has controls to prevent theft or misuse (including
being non-exportable / non-recoverable), the Attesting Environment
has to collect claims about this secure environment (or Target
Environment, as shown in {{fig-attester}}).

{{fig-attester}} shows the interaction inside an Attester. The
Attesting Environment, which is provisioned with an Attestation Key,
retrieves claims about the Target Environment. The Target
Environment offers key generation, storage and usage, which it
makes available to services. The Attesting Environment collects
these claims about the Target Environment and signs them and
exports Evidence for use in remote attestation via a CSR.

{: #fig-attester title="Interaction between Attesting and Target Environment"}

{{fig-attester}} places the CSR library outside the Attester, which
is an implementation choice. The CSR library may also be located
inside the trusted computing base. Regardless of the placement
of the CSR library an Attesting Environment MUST be able to collect
claims about the Target Environment such that statements about
the storage of the keying material can be made. For example, one
implementation may perform a software measurement of the CSR library
along with the crypto library implementation that has access to the
keying material. For the Verifier, the provided Evidence must allow
an assessment to be made whether the key used to sign the CSR
is stored in a secure location and cannot be exported.

Evidence communicated in the attributes and structures defined
in this document are meant to be used in a CSR. It is up to
the Verifier and to the Relying Party (RA/CA) to place as much or
as little trust in this information as dictated by policies.

This document defines the transport of Evidence of different formats
in a CSR. Some of these encoding formats are based on standards
while others are proprietary formats. A Verifier will need to understand
these formats for matching the received claim values against policies.

Policies drive the processing of Evidence at the Verifier: the Verifier's
Appraisal Policy for Evidence will often be based on specifications by the manufacturer
of a hardware security module, a regulatory agency, or specified by an
oversight body, such as the CA Browser Forum. The Code-Signing Baseline
Requirements {{CSBR}} document is an example of such a policy that has
been published by the CA Browser Forum and specifies certain properties,
such as non-exportability, which must be enabled for storing
publicly-trusted code-signing keys. Other
policies influence the decision making at the Relying Party when
evaluating the Attestation Result. The Relying Party is ultimately
responsible for making a decision of what information in the Attestation
Result it will accept. The presence of the attributes defined in this
specification provide the Relying Party with additional assurance about
an Attester. Policies used at the Verifier and the Relying Party are
implementation dependent and out of scope for this document. Whether to
require the use of Evidence in a CSR is out-of-scope for this document.

## Freshness

Evidence generated by an Attester generally needs to be fresh to provide
value to the Verifier since the configuration on the device may change
over time. Section 10 of {{RFC9334}} discusses different approaches for
providing freshness, including a nonce-based approach, the use of timestamps
and an epoch-based technique.  The use of nonces requires an extra message
exchange via the Relying Party and the use of timestamps requires
synchronized clocks. Epochs also require (unidirectional) communication.
None of these things are practical when interacting with Hardware Security
Modules (HSM).

Additionally, the definition of "fresh" is somewhat ambiguous in the context
of CSRs, especially considering that non-automated certificate enrollments
are often asyncronous, and considering the common practice of re-using the
same CSR for multiple certificate renewals across the lifetime of a key.
"Freshness" typically implies both asserting that the data was generated
at a certain point-in-time, as well as providing non-replayability.
Certain use cases may have special properties impacting the freshness
requirements. For example, HSMs are typically designed to not allow downgrade
of private key storage properties; for example if a given key was asserted at
time T to have been generated inside the hardware boundary and to be
non-exportable, then it can be assumed that those properties of that key
will continue to hold into the future.

Developers, operators, and designers of protocols, which embed
Evidence-carrying-CSRs, need to consider what notion of freshness is
appropriate and available in-context; thus the issue of freshness is
left up to the discretion of protocol designers and implementors.

## Publishing evidence in an X.509 extension

This document specifies and Extension for carrying Evidence in a CRMF Certificate Signing Request (CSR), but it is intentionally NOT RECOMMENDED for a CA to copy the ext-evidence or ext-evidenceCerts extensions into the published certificate.
The reason for this is that certificates are considered public information and the Evidence might contain detailed information about hardware and patch levels of the device on which the private key resides.
The certificate requester has consented to sharing this detailed device information with the CA but might not consent to having these details published.
These privacy considerations are beyond the scope of this document and may require additional signaling mechanisms in the CSR to prevent unintended publication of sensitive information, so we leave it as "NOT RECOMMENDED".

# Examples

This section provides two non-normative examples for embedding Evidence
in CSRs. The first example embeds Evidence produced by a TPM in the CSR.
The second example conveys an Arm Platform Security Architecture token,
which provides claims about the used hardware and software platform,
into the CSR.

At the time of writing, the authors are not aware of registered OIDs for these evidence formats, and so we leave the OIDs as TBD1 / TBD2.

##  TPM V2.0 Evidence in CSR

The following example illustrates a CSR with a signed TPM Quote based on
{{TPM20}}. The Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) are fixed-size
registers in a TPM that record measurements of software and configuration
information and are therefore used to capture the system state. The digests
stored in these registers are then digitially signed with an attestation
key known to the hardware.

Note: The information conveyed in the value field of the EvidenceStatement
structure may contain more information than the signed TPM Quote structure
defined in the TPM v2.0 specification {{TPM20}}, such as plaintext PCR values,
the up-time, the event log, etc. The detailed structure of such
payload is, however, not defined in this document and may be subject to
future standardization work in supplementary documents.
