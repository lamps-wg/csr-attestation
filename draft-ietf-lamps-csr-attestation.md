--- abstract

A client requesting a certificate from a Certification Authority (CA) may wish to offer believable claims about the protections afforded to the corresponding private key, such as whether the private key resides on a hardware security module or the protection capabilities provided by the hardware.

This document describes how to encode Evidence produced by an Attester for inclusion in Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), and any certificates necessary for validating it.

Including Evidence along with a CSR can help to improve the assessment of the security posture for the private key, and the trustworthiness properties of the submitted key to the requested certificate profile. These Evidence Claims can include information about the hardware component's manufacturer, the version of installed or running firmware, the version of software installed or running in layers above the firmware, or the presence of hardware components providing specific protection capabilities or shielded locations (e.g., to protect keys).

# Introduction

When requesting a certificate from a Certification Authority (CA), a PKI end entity may wish to include Evidence of the security properties of its environments in which the private keys are stored in that request.
This Evidence can be appraised by authoritative entities, such as a Registration Authority (RA) or a CA, or associated trusted Verifiers as part of validating an incoming certificate request against given certificate policies.
This specification defines an attribute and an extension that allow for conveyance of Evidence in Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) in either PKCS#10 {{RFC2986}} or Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) {{RFC4211}} payloads.

As outlined in the RATS Architecture {{RFC9334}}, an Attester (typically
a device) produces a signed collection of Claims that constitutes Evidence about its running environment.
While the term "attestation" is not defined in RFC 9334, it was later defined in {{?I-D.ietf-rats-tpm-based-network-device-attest}}, it refers to the activity of producing and appraising remote attestation Evidence.
A Relying Party may consult an Attestation Result produced by a Verifier that has appraised the Evidence in making policy decisions about the trustworthiness of the
Target Environment being assessed via appraisal of Evidence. {{architecture}} provides the basis to illustrate in this document how the various roles
in the RATS architecture map to a certificate requester and a CA/RA.


At the time of writing, several standard and several proprietary attestation technologies
are in use.
This specification thereby is intended to be as technology-agnostic as it is feasible with respect to implemented remote attestation technologies. Instead, it focuses on (1) the conveyance of Evidence via CSRs while making minimal assumptions about content or format of the transported Evidence and (2) the conveyance of sets of certificates used for validation of Evidence.
The certificates typically contain one or more certification paths
rooted in a device manufacture trust anchor and the leaf certificate being
on the device in question; the latter is the Attestation Key that signs the Evidence statement.

This document specifies two ATTRIBUTE/Attribute definitions. The first
Attribute may be used to carry a set of certificates or public keys that
may be required to validate signed Evidence. The second Attribute carries a
structure that may be used to convey Evidence.

A CSR may contain one or more Evidence payloads, for example Evidence
asserting the storage properties of a private key as well Evidence
asserting firmware version and other general properties
of the device, or Evidence signed using different cryptographic
algorithms.

With these attributes, additional
information about whether to issue a certificate and what information
to populate into the certificate is available to an RA or CA. The scope of this document is, however,
limited to the conveyance of Evidence within CSR. The exact format of the
Evidence being conveyed is defined in various standard and proprietary
specifications.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document re-uses the terms defined in {{RFC9334}} related to remote
attestation. Readers of this document are assumed to be familiar with
the following terms: Evidence, Claim, Attestation Results (AR), Attester,
Verifier, Target Environment, Attesting Environment, and Relying Party (RP).

The term "Certification Request" message is defined in {{RFC2986}}.
Specifications, such as {{RFC7030}}, later introduced the term
"Certificate Signing Request (CSR)" to refer to the Certification
Request message. While the term "Certification Signing Request"
would have been correct, the mistake was unnoticed. In the meanwhile
CSR is an abbreviation used beyond PKCS#10. Hence, it is equally
applicable to other protocols that use a different syntax and
even a different encoding, in particular this document also
considers Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) {{RFC4211}}
to be "CSRs". We use the terms "CSR" and Certificate Request
message interchangeably.

# Architecture {#architecture}

{{fig-arch}} shows the high-level communication pattern of the RATS
background check model where the Attester transmits the Evidence in the
CSR to the RA and the CA, which is subsequently forwarded to the Verifier.
The Verifier appraises the received Evidence and computes an Attestation
Result, which is then processed by the RA/CA prior to the certificate
issuance.

In addition to the background check model the RATS architecture also
specifies the passport model and combinations. See Section 5.2 of
{{RFC9334}} for a description of the passport model. The passport model
requires the Attester to transmit Evidence to the Verifier directly in order
to obtain the Attestation Result, which is then forwarded to the Relying
Party. This specification utilizes the background model since CSRs are
often used as one-shot messages where no direct real-time interaction
between the Attester and the Verifier is possible.

Note that the Verifier is a logical role that may be included in the
RA/CA product. In this case the Relying Party and Verifier collapse into a
single entity. The Verifier functionality can, however,
also be kept separate from the RA/CA functionality, such as a utility or
library provided by the device manufacturer. For example,
security concerns may require parsers of Evidence formats to be logically
or physically separated from the core CA functionality.

{: #fig-arch title="Architecture with Background Check Model."}

As discussed in RFC 9334, different security and privacy aspects need to be
considered. For example, Evidence may need to be protected against replay and
Section 10 of RFC 9334 lists approach for offering freshness. There are also
concerns about the exposure of persistent identifiers by utilizing attestation
technology, which are discussed in Section 11 of RFC 9334. Finally, the keying
material used by the Attester need to be protected against unauthorized access,
and against signing arbitrary content that originated from outside the device.
This aspect is described in Section 12 of RFC 9334. Most of these aspects are,
however, outside the scope of this specification but relevant for use with a
given attestation technology. The focus of this specification is on the
transport of Evidence from the Attester to the Relying Party via existing
CSR messages.

# ASN.1 Elements

##  Object Identifiers

We reference `id-pkix` and `id-aa`, both defined in {{!RFC5912}}.

We define:

~~~
-- Arc for Evidence types
id-ata OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix (TBD1) }
~~~


## Evidence Attribute and Extension

By definition, Attributes within a PKCS#10 CSR are
typed as ATTRIBUTE and within a CRMF CSR are typed as EXTENSION.
This attribute definition contains one or more
Evidence bundles of type `EvidenceBundle` which each contain
one or more Evidence statements of a type `EvidenceStatement` along with
an optional certificate chain.
This structure allows for grouping Evidence statements that share a
certificate chain.

~~~
EVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER

EvidenceStatementSet EVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= {
   ... -- Empty for now --
}

EvidenceStatement ::= SEQUENCE {
   type   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&id({EvidenceStatementSet}),
   stmt   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&Type({EvidenceStatementSet}{@type})
}

EvidenceBundle ::= SEQUENCE
{
  evidence  SEQUENCE OF EvidenceStatement,
  certs SEQUENCE OF CertificateAlternatives
}

id-aa-evidenceStatement OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aa TBDAA }

-- For PKCS#10
attr-evidence ATTRIBUTE ::= {
  TYPE SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle
  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement
}

-- For CRMF
ext-evidence EXTENSION ::= {
  SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle
  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement
}
~~~

The Extension version is intended only for use within CRMF CSRs and MUST NOT be used within X.509 certificates due to the privacy implications of publishing Evidence about the end entity's hardware environment. See {{security-considerations}} for more discussion.

The `certs` contains a set of certificates that
may be needed to validate the contents of an Evidence statement
contained in `evidence`. The set of certificates should contain
the object that contains the public key needed to directly validate the
`evidence`.  The remaining elements should chain that data back to
an agreed upon trust anchor used for attestation. No order is implied, it is
up to the Attester and its Verifier to agree on both the order and format
of certificates contained in `certs`.

A CSR MAY contain one or more instances of `attr-evidence` or `ext-evidence`.
This means that the `SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle` is redundant with the
ability to carry multiple `attr-evidence` or `ext-evidence` at the CSR level;
either mechanism MAY be used for carrying multiple Evidence bundles.
We are leaving the `SEQUENCE OF EvidenceBundle` since it is in general
more flexible than relying on the containing structure to handle multiplicity
and allows for this structure to be re-used in the future in other PKIX
protocol contexts.


##  CertificateAlternatives

This is an ASN.1 CHOICE construct used to represent an encoding of a
broad variety of certificate types.

~~~
CertificateAlternatives ::=
   CHOICE {
      cert Certificate,
      typedCert     [0] IMPLICIT TypedCert,
      typedFlatCert [1] IMPLICIT TypedFlatCert
   }
~~~

"Certificate" is a standard X.509 certificate that MUST be compliant

with RFC 5280.  Enforcement of this constraint is left to the relying
parties.

"TypedCert" is an ASN.1 construct that has the charateristics of a
certificate, but is not encoded as an X.509 certificate.  The
certType Field (below) indicates how to interpret the certBody field.  While
it is possible to carry any type of data in this structure, it's
intended the content field include data for at least one public key
formatted as a SubjectPublicKeyInfo (see {{RFC5912}}).

~~~
TYPED-CERT ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER

CertType ::= TYPED-CERT.&id

TypedCert ::= SEQUENCE {
              certType     TYPED-CERT.&id({TypedCertSet}),
              content     TYPED-CERT.&Type ({TypedCertSet}{@certType})
          }

TypedCertSet TYPED-CERT ::= {
             ... -- Empty for now,
             }
~~~

"TypedFlatCert" is a certificate that does not have a valid ASN.1
encoding.
These are often compact or implicit certificates used by smart cards.
certType indicates the format of the data in the
certBody field, and ideally refers to a published specification.

~~~
TypedFlatCert ::= SEQUENCE {
    certType OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
    certBody OCTET STRING
}
~~~

# IANA Considerations

IANA is requested to open one new registry, allocate a value
from the "SMI Security for PKIX Module Identifier" registry for the
included ASN.1 module, and allocate values from "SMI Security for

# Security Considerations

A PKCS#10 or CRMF Certification Request message consists of a
distinguished name, a public key, and optionally a set of attributes,
collectively signed by the entity requesting certification.
The private key used to sign the CSR MUST be different from the
Attesting Key utilized to sign Evidence about the Target
Environment. Key separation is an important principle in cryptography
and also applies to this specification with regards to the Attestation Key
and the CSR signing key. To demonstrate that the private
key applied to sign the CSR is generated, and stored in a secure
environment that has controls to prevent theft or misuse (including
being non-exportable / non-recoverable), the Attesting Environment
has to collect claims about this secure environment (or Target
Environment, as shown in {{fig-attester}}).

{{fig-attester}} shows the interaction inside an Attester. The
Attesting Environment, which is provisioned with an Attestation Key,
retrieves claims about the Target Environment. The Target
Environment offers key generation, storage and usage, which it
makes available to services. The Attesting Environment collects
these claims about the Target Environment and signs them and
exports Evidence for use in remote attestation via a CSR.

{: #fig-attester title="Interaction between Attesting and Target Environment"}

{{fig-attester}} places the CSR library outside the Attester, which
is an implementation choice. The CSR library may also be located
inside the trusted computing base. Regardless of the placement
of the CSR library an Attesting Environment MUST be able to collect
claims about the Target Environment such that statements about
the storage of the keying material can be made. For example, one
implementation may perform a software measurement of the CSR library
along with the crypto library implementation that has access to the
keying material. For the Verifier, the provided Evidence must allow
an assessment to be made whether the key used to sign the CSR
is stored in a secure location and cannot be exported.

Evidence communicated in the attributes and structures defined
in this document are meant to be used in a CSR. It is up to
the Verifier and to the Relying Party (RA/CA) to place as much or
as little trust in this information as dictated by policies.

This document defines the transport of Evidence of different formats
in a CSR. Some of these encoding formats are based on standards
while others are proprietary formats. A Verifier will need to understand
these formats for matching the received claim values against policies.

Policies drive the processing of Evidence at the Verifier: the Verifier's
Appraisal Policy for Evidence will often be based on specifications by the manufacturer
of a hardware security module, a regulatory agency, or specified by an
oversight body, such as the CA Browser Forum. The Code-Signing Baseline
Requirements {{CSBR}} document is an example of such a policy that has
been published by the CA Browser Forum and specifies certain properties,
such as non-exportability, which must be enabled for storing
publicly-trusted code-signing keys. Other
policies influence the decision making at the Relying Party when
evaluating the Attestation Result. The Relying Party is ultimately
responsible for making a decision of what information in the Attestation
Result it will accept. The presence of the attributes defined in this
specification provide the Relying Party with additional assurance about
an Attester. Policies used at the Verifier and the Relying Party are
implementation dependent and out of scope for this document. Whether to
require the use of Evidence in a CSR is out-of-scope for this document.

## Freshness

Evidence generated by an Attester generally needs to be fresh to provide
value to the Verifier since the configuration on the device may change
over time. Section 10 of {{RFC9334}} discusses different approaches for
providing freshness, including a nonce-based approach, the use of timestamps
and an epoch-based technique.  The use of nonces requires an extra message
exchange via the Relying Party and the use of timestamps requires
synchronized clocks. Epochs also require (unidirectional) communication.
None of these things are practical when interacting with Hardware Security
Modules (HSM).

Additionally, the definition of "fresh" is somewhat ambiguous in the context
of CSRs, especially considering that non-automated certificate enrollments
are often asyncronous, and considering the common practice of re-using the
same CSR for multiple certificate renewals across the lifetime of a key.
"Freshness" typically implies both asserting that the data was generated
at a certain point-in-time, as well as providing non-replayability.
Certain use cases may have special properties impacting the freshness
requirements. For example, HSMs are typically designed to not allow downgrade
of private key storage properties; for example if a given key was asserted at
time T to have been generated inside the hardware boundary and to be
non-exportable, then it can be assumed that those properties of that key
will continue to hold into the future.

Developers, operators, and designers of protocols, which embed
Evidence-carrying-CSRs, need to consider what notion of freshness is
appropriate and available in-context; thus the issue of freshness is
left up to the discretion of protocol designers and implementors.

## Publishing evidence in an X.509 extension

This document specifies and Extension for carrying Evidence in a CRMF Certificate Signing Request (CSR), but it is intentionally NOT RECOMMENDED for a CA to copy the ext-evidence or ext-evidenceCerts extensions into the published certificate.
The reason for this is that certificates are considered public information and the Evidence might contain detailed information about hardware and patch levels of the device on which the private key resides.
The certificate requester has consented to sharing this detailed device information with the CA but might not consent to having these details published.
These privacy considerations are beyond the scope of this document and may require additional signaling mechanisms in the CSR to prevent unintended publication of sensitive information, so we leave it as "NOT RECOMMENDED".

# Examples

This section provides two non-normative examples for embedding Evidence
in CSRs. The first example embeds Evidence produced by a TPM in the CSR.
The second example conveys an Arm Platform Security Architecture token,
which provides claims about the used hardware and software platform,
into the CSR.

At the time of writing, the authors are not aware of registered OIDs for these evidence formats, and so we leave the OIDs as TBD1 / TBD2.

##  TPM V2.0 Evidence in CSR

The following example illustrates a CSR with a signed TPM Quote based on
{{TPM20}}. The Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) are fixed-size
registers in a TPM that record measurements of software and configuration
information and are therefore used to capture the system state. The digests
stored in these registers are then digitially signed with an attestation
key known to the hardware.

Note: The information conveyed in the value field of the EvidenceStatement
structure may contain more information than the signed TPM Quote structure
defined in the TPM v2.0 specification {{TPM20}}, such as plaintext PCR values,
the up-time, the event log, etc. The detailed structure of such
payload is, however, not defined in this document and may be subject to
future standardization work in supplementary documents.

## Platform Security Architecture Attestation Token in CSR

The example shown in {{fig-example-psa}} illustrates how the Arm
Platform Security Architecture (PSA) Attestation Token
is conveyed in a CSR. The content of the Evidence in this example is re-used
from {{I-D.tschofenig-rats-psa-token}} and contains an Entity Attestation
Token (EAT) digitally signed with an attestation private key.
