--- abstract

A client requesting a certificate from a Certification Authority (CA) may wish to offer believable claims about the protections afforded to the corresponding private key, such as whether the private key resides on a hardware securtiy model or trusted platform module, and the protection capabilities provided by the hardware module.
Including this evidence along with the certificate request can help to improve the assessment of the security posture for the private key, and suitability of the submitted key to the requested certificate profile.
These evidence claims can include information about the hardware component's manufacturer, the version of installed or running firmware, the version of software installed or running in layers above the firmware, or the presence of hardware components providing specific protection capabilities or shielded locations (e.g., to protect keys).
Producing, conveying, and appraising such believable claims is enabled via remote attestation procedures where the device holding the private key takes on the role of an attester and produces evidence that is made available to remote parties in a cryptographically secured way.
This document describes two new extensions to encode evidence produced by an attester
for inclusion in PKCS#10 or CRMF certificate signing requests: an ASN.1 Attribute or Extension definition to convey a cryptographically-signed evidence statement to a Registration Authority or to a Certification Authority, and an ASN.1 Attribute or Extension to carry any certificates necessary for validating the cryptographically-signed evidence statement.

# Introduction

At the time that it is requesting a certificate from a Certification Authority (CA), a PKI end entity may wish to provide evidence of the security properties of the environment in which the private key is stored.
This evidence is to be verified by a relying party such as the Registration Authority or the Certification Authority as part of validating an incoming certificate request against a given certificate policy.
This specification provides a newly defined evidence attribute for carrying evidence in Certificate Requests (CSR) in either PKCS#10 {{RFC2986}} or Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) {{RFC4211}}.

As outlined in the RATS Architecture {{RFC9334}}, an Attester (typically
a device) produces a signed collection of evidence about its running environment.
The term "attestation" is intentionally not defined in RFC 9334, but it is often taken to mean the overall process of producing and verifying evidence.
A Relying Party may consult that evidence, or an attestation result produced by a verifier who has checked the evidence, in making policy decisions about the trustworthiness of the
target environment being attested. {{architecture}} overviews how the various roles
in the RATS architecture map to a certificate requester and a CA/RA.


At the time of writing, several standard and several proprietary attestation technologies
are in use.
This specification thereby tries to be technology-agnostic with regards to the attestation technologies and instead focused on the transport of Evidence.

This document is focused on the transport of evidence
inside a CSR and makes minimal assumptions about content or format of the transported evidence.
We also enable conveyance of a set of certificates used for validation of
evidence. These certificates typically contain one or more certificate chains
rooted in a device manufacture trust anchor and the leaf certificate being
on the device in question; the latter is the Attestation Key that signs the evidence statement.

This document creates two ATTRIBUTE/Attribute definitions. The first
Attribute may be used to carry a set of certificates or public keys that
may be necessary to validate evidence. The second Attribute carries a
structure that may be used to carry evidence.

A CSR may contain one or more evidence, for example evidence
asserting the storage properties of the private key as well evidence
asserting the firmware version and other general properties
of the device, or evidence signed by certificate chains
on different cryptographic algorithms.

With these attributes, an RA or CA has additional
information about whether to issue a certificate and what information
to populate into the certificate. The scope of this document is, however,
limited to the transport of evidence via a CSR. The exact format of the
evidence being carried is defined in various standard and proprietary
specifications.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document re-uses the terms defined in {{RFC9334}} related to remote
attestation. Readers of this document are assumed to be familiar with
the following terms: Evidence, Claim, Attestation Results (AR), Attester,
Verifier, and Relying Party (RP).

The term "Certification Request" message is defined in {{RFC2986}}.
Specifications, such as {{RFC7030}}, later introduced the term
"Certificate Signing Request (CSR)" to refer to the Certification
Request message. While the term "Certification Signing Request"
would have been correct, the mistake was unnoticed. In the meanwhile
CSR is an abbreviation used beyond PKCS#10. Hence, it is equally
applicable to other protocols that use a different syntax and
even a different encoding, in particular this document also
considers Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) {{RFC4211}}
to be "CSRs". We use the terms "CSR" and Certificate Request
message interchangeably.

# Architecture {#architecture}

{{fig-arch}} shows the high-level communication pattern of the RATS passport
model where the attester transmits the evidence in the CSR to the RA
and the CA. The verifier processes the received evidence and computes
an attestation result, which is then processed by the RA/CA prior to the
certificate issuance.

Note that the verifier is a logical role that may be included in the
RA/CA product. In this case the Relying Party and Verifier collapse into a
single entity. The verifier functionality can, however,
also be kept separate from the RA/CA functionality, such as a utility or
library provided by the device manufacturer. For example,
security concerns may require parsers of evidence formats to be logically
or physically separated from the core CA functionality.

{: #fig-arch title="Architecture"}

As discussed in RFC 9334, different security and privacy aspects need to be
considered. For example, evidence may need to be protected against replay and
Section 10 of RFC 9334 lists approach for offering freshness. There are also
concerns about the exposure of persistent identifiers by utilizing attestation
technology, which are discussed in Section 11 of RFC 9334. Finally, the keying
material used by the attester need to be protected against unauthorized access,
and against signing arbitrary content that originated from outside the device.
This aspect is described in Section 12 of RFC 9334. Most of these aspects are,
however, outside the scope of this specification but relevant for use with a
given attestation technology. The focus of this specification is on the
transport of evidence from the attester to the relying party via existing
CSR messages.

# ASN.1 Elements

##  Object Identifiers

We reference `id-pkix` and `id-aa`, both defined in {{!RFC5912}}.

We define:

~~~
-- Arc for evidence types
id-ata OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix (TBD1) }
~~~


## Evidence Attribute and Extension

By definition, Attributes within a PKCS#10 CSR are
typed as ATTRIBUTE and within a CRMF CSR are typed as EXTENSION.
This attribute definition contains one or more
evidence statements of a type "EvidenceStatement".

~~~
id-aa-evidenceStatement OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aa (TBDAA2) }

-- For PKCS#10
attr-evidence ATTRIBUTE ::= {
  TYPE EvidenceStatement
  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement
}

-- For CRMF
ext-evidence EXTENSION ::= {
  TYPE EvidenceStatement
  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement
}
~~~

A CSR MAY contain one or more instance of `EvidenceAttribute`.

The Extension version is intended only for use within CRMF CSRs and is NOT RECOMMENDED for use within X.509 certificates due to the privacy implications of publishing evidence about the end entity's hardware environment. See {{security-considerations}} for more discussion.


##  EvidenceStatement

An EvidenceStatement is a simple type-value pair identified by an OID
`type` and containing a value `stmt`.

encoded as
a sequence, of which the type of the "value" field is
controlled by the value of the "type" field, similar to an Attribute
definition.

~~~
EVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER

EvidenceStatementSet EVIDENCE-STATEMENT ::= {
   ... -- Empty for now --
}

EvidenceStatement {EVIDENCE-STATEMENT:EvidenceStatementSet} ::= SEQUENCE {
   type   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&id({EvidenceStatementSet}),
   stmt   EVIDENCE-STATEMENT.&Type({EvidenceStatementSet}{@type})
}

id-aa-evidenceStatement OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aa aa-evidenceStatement(TBDAA2) }

-- For PKCS#10
attr-evidence ATTRIBUTE ::= {
  TYPE EvidenceStatement
  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement
}

-- For CRMF
ext-evidence EXTENSION ::= {
  TYPE EvidenceStatement
  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceStatement
}
~~~

##  EvidenceCerts

The "EvidenceCertsAttribute" contains a set of certificates that
may be needed to validate the contents of an evidence statement
contained in an evidenceAttribute. The set of certificates should contain
the object that contains the public key needed to directly validate the
EvidenceAttribute.  The remaining elements should chain that data back to
an agreed upon trust anchor used for attestation. No order is implied, it is
the Verifier's responsibility to perform the appropriate certification path
construction.

A CSR MUST contain at zero or one `EvidenceCertsAttribute`. In the case where
the CSR contains multiple instances of `EvidenceAttribute` representing
multiple evidence statements, all necessary certificates MUST be contained in
the same instance of `EvidenceCertsAttribute`.
`EvidenceCertsAttribute` MAY be omitted if there are no certificates to convey, for example if they are already known to the verifier, or if they are contained in the evidence statement.


~~~
id-aa-evidenceChainCerts OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aa (TBDAA1) }

-- For PKCS#10
attr-evidenceCerts ATTRIBUTE ::= {
  TYPE SEQUENCE OF CertificateChoice
  COUNTS MAX 1
  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceChainCerts
}

-- For CRMF
ext-evidenceCerts EXTENSION ::= {
  TYPE SEQUENCE OF CertificateChoice
  COUNTS MAX 1
  IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-evidenceChainCerts
}
~~~

The Extension version is intended only for use within CRMF CSRs and is NOT RECOMMENDED for use within X.509 certificates due to the privacy implications of publishing evidence about the end entity's hardware environment. See {{security-considerations}} for more discussion.

##  CertificateChoice

This is an ASN.1 CHOICE construct used to represent an encoding of a
broad variety of certificate types.

~~~
CertificateChoice ::=
   CHOICE {
      cert Certificate,
      opaqueCert    [0] IMPLICIT OCTET STRING,
      typedCert     [1] IMPLICIT TypedCert,
      typedFlatCert [2] IMPLICIT TypedFlatCert
   }
~~~

"Certificate" is a standard X.509 certificate that MUST be compliant

with RFC 5280.  Enforcement of this constraint is left to the relying
parties.

"opaqueCert" should be used sparingly as it requires the verifier to implictly know its format.
It is encoded as an OCTET STRING.

"TypedCert" is an ASN.1 construct that has the charateristics of a
certificate, but is not encoded as an X.509 certificate.  The
certType Field (below) indicates how to interpret the certBody field.  While
it is possible to carry any type of data in this structure, it's
intended the content field include data for at least one public key
formatted as a SubjectPublicKeyInfo (see {{RFC5912}}).

~~~
TYPED-CERT ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER

CertType ::= TYPED-CERT.&id

TypedCert ::= SEQUENCE {
              certType     TYPED-CERT.&id({TypedCertSet}),
              content     TYPED-CERT.&Type ({TypedCertSet}{@certType})
          }

TypedCertSet TYPED-CERT ::= {
             ... -- Empty for now,
             }
~~~

"TypedFlatCert" is a certificate that does not have a valid ASN.1
encoding.
These are often compact or implicit certificates used by smart cards.
certType indicates the format of the data in the
certBody field, and ideally refers to a published specification.

~~~
TypedFlatCert ::= SEQUENCE {
    certType OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
    certBody OCTET STRING
}
~~~

# IANA Considerations

The IANA is requested to open one new registry, allocate a value
from the "SMI Security for PKIX Module Identifier" registry for the
included ASN.1 module, and allocate values from "SMI Security for
S/MIME Attributes" to identify two Attributes defined within.

# Security Considerations

A PKCS#10 or CRMF Certification Request message consists of a
distinguished name, a public key, and optionally a set of attributes,
collectively signed by the entity requesting certification.
The private key used to sign the CSR MUST be different from the
Attesting Key utilized to sign Evidence about the Target
Environment. Key separation is an important principle in cryptography
and also applies to this specification with regards to the Attestation Key
and the CSR signing key. To demonstrate that the private
key applied to sign the CSR is generated, and stored in a secure
environment that has controls to prevent theft or misuse (including
being non-exportable / non-recoverable), the Attesting Environment
has to collect claims about this secure environment (or Target
Environment, as shown in {{fig-attester}}).

{{fig-attester}} shows the interaction inside an Attester. The
Attesting Environment, which is provisioned with an Attestation Key,
retrieves claims about the Target Environment. The Target
Environment offers key generation, storage and usage, which it
makes available to services. The Attesting Environment collects
these claims about the Target Environment and signs them and
exports Evidence for use in remote attestation via a CSR.

{: #fig-attester title="Interaction between Attesting and Target Environment"}

{{fig-attester}} places the CSR library outside the Attester, which
is an implementation choice. The CSR library may also be located
inside the trusted computing base. Regardless of the placement
of the CSR library an Attesting Environment MUST be able to collect
claims about the Target Environment such that statements about
the storage of the keying material can be made. For example, one
implementation may perform a software measurement of the CSR library
along with the crypto library implementation that has access to the
keying material. For the Verifier, the provided Evidence must allow
an assessment to be made whether the key used to sign the CSR
is stored in a secure location and cannot be exported.

Evidence communicated in the attributes and structures defined
in this document are meant to be used in a CSR. It is up to
the Verifier and to the Relying Party (RA/CA) to place as much or
as little trust in this information as dictated by policies.

This document defines the transport of Evidence of different formats
in a CSR. Some of these encoding formats are based on standards
while others are proprietary formats. A Verifier will need to understand
these formats for matching the received claim values against policies.

Policies drive the processing of Evidence at the Verifier: the Verifier's
Appraisal Policy for Evidence will often be specified by the manufacturer
of a hardware security module or specified by a regulatory body such as
the CA Browser Forum Code-Signing Baseline Requirements {{CSBR}} which
specifies certain properties, such as non-exportability, which must be
enabled for storing publicly-trusted code-signing keys. Other
policies influence the decision making at the Relying Party when
evaluating the Attestation Result. The Relying Party is ultimately
responsible for making a decision of what information in the Attestation
Result it will accept. The presence of the attributes defined in this
specification provide the Relying Party with additional assurance about
an Attester. Policies used at the Verifier and the Relying Party are
implementation dependent and out of scope for this document. Whether to
require the use of Evidence in a CSR is out-of-scope for this document.

## Freshness

Evidence generated by an attester generally needs to be fresh to provide
value to the verifier since the configuration on the device may change
over time. Section 10 of {{RFC9334}} discusses different approaches for
providing freshness, including a nonce-based approach, the use of timestamps
and an epoch-based technique.  The use of nonces requires an extra message
exchange via the relying party and the use of timestamps requires
synchronized clocks. Epochs also require (unidirectional) communication.
None of these things are practical when interacting with Hardware Security
Modules (HSM).

Additionally, the definition of "fresh" is somewhat ambiguous in the context
of CSRs, especially considering that non-automated certificate enrollments
are often asyncronous, and considering the common practice of re-using the
same CSR for multiple certificate renewals across the lifetime of a key.
"Freshness" typically implies both asserting that the data was generated
at a certain point-in-time, as well as providing non-replayability.
Certain use cases may have special properties impacting the freshness
requirements. For example, HSMs are typically designed to not allow downgrade
of private key storage properties; for example if a given key was asserted at
time T to have been generated inside the hardware boundary and to be
non-exportable, then it can be assumed that those properties of that key
will continue to hold into the future.

Developers, operators, and designers of protocols, which embed
Evidence-carrying-CSRs, need to consider what notion of freshness is
appropriate and available in-context; thus the issue of freshness is
left up to the discretion of protocol designers and implementors.

## Publishing evidence in an X.509 extension

This document specifies and Extension for carrying evidence in a CRMF Certificate Signing Request (CSR), but it is intentionally NOT RECOMMENDED for a CA to copy the ext-evidence or ext-evidenceCerts extensions into the published certificate.
The reason for this is that certificates are considered public information and the evidence might contain detailed information about hardware and patch levels of the device on which the private key resides.
The certificate requester has consented to sharing this detailed device information with the CA but might not consent to having these details published.
These privacy considerations are beyond the scope of this document and may require additional signaling mechanisms in the CSR to prevent unintended publication of sensitive information, so we leave it as "NOT RECOMMENDED".

# Examples

This section provides two non-normative examples for embedding evidence
in in CSRs. The first example conveys Arm Platform Security Architecture
tokens, which provides claims about the used hardware and software platform,
into the CSR. The second example embeds the TPM v2.0 evidence in the CSR.

##  TPM V2.0 Evidence in CSR

The following example illustrates a CSR with a signed TPM Quote based on
{{TPM20}}. The Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) are fixed-size
registers in a TPM that record measurements of software and configuration
information and are therefore used to capture the system state. The digests
stored in these registers are then digitially signed with an attestation
key known to the hardware.

Note: The information conveyed in the value field of the EvidenceStatement
structure may contain more information than the signed TPM Quote structure
defined in the TPM v2.0 specification {{TPM20}}, such as plaintext PCR values,
the up-time, the event log, etc. The detailed structure of such
payload is, however, not defined in this document and may be subject to
future standardization work in supplementary documents.
