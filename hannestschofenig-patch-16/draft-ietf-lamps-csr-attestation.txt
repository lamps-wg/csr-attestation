     Use of Remote Attestation with Certification Signing Requests
                draft-ietf-lamps-csr-attestation-latest

Abstract

   Certification Authorities (CAs) issuing certificates to Public Key
   Infrastructure (PKI) end entities may require a certificate signing
   request (CSR) to include additional verifiable information to confirm
   policy compliance.  For example, a CA may require an end entity to
   demonstrate that the private key corresponding to a CSR's public key
   is secured by a hardware security module (HSM), is not exportable,
   etc.  The process of generating, transmitting, and verifying
   additional information required by the CA is called remote
   attestation.  While work is currently underway to standardize various
   aspects of remote attestation, a variety of proprietary mechanisms
   have been in use for years, particularly regarding protection of
   private keys.

   This specification defines an ASN.1 structure for remote attestation
   that can accommodate proprietary and standardized attestation
   mechanisms, as well as an attribute and an extension to carry the
   structure in PKCS#10 and Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF)
   messages, respectively.

1.  Introduction

   Certification Authorities (CAs) issuing certificates to PKI end
   entities may require a certificate signing request (CSR) to include
   verifiable attestations that contain claims regarding the platform
   used by the end entity to generate the key pair for which a
   certificate is sought.  At the time of writing, the most pressing
   example of the need for remote attestation in certificate enrollment
   is the Code-Signing Baseline Requirements (CSBR) document maintained
   by the CA/Browser Forum [CSBR].  The [CSBR] requires compliant CAs to
   "ensure that a Subscriber's Private Key is generated, stored, and
   used in a secure environment that has controls to prevent theft or
   misuse".  This requirement is a natural fit to enforce via remote
   attestation.

   This specification defines an attribute and an extension that allow
   for conveyance of verifiable attestations in several Certificate
   Signing Request (CSR) formats, including PKCS#10 [RFC2986] or
   Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) [RFC4211] messages.  Given
   several standard and proprietary remote attestation technologies are
   in use, this specification is intended to be as technology-agnostic
   as is feasible with respect to implemented and future remote
   attestation technologies.  This aligns with the fact that a CA may
   wish to provide support for a variety of types of devices but cannot
   dictate what format a device uses to represent attestations.

   While CSRs are defined using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1),
   attestations may be defined using any data description language,
   i.e., ASN.1 or Concise Data Description Language (CDDL), or
   represented using any type of encoding, including Distinguished
   Encoding Rules (DER), Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR),
   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).  This specification RECOMMENDS
   that attestations that are not encoded using the Basic Encoding Rules
   (BER) or Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) be wrapped in an ASN.1
   OCTET STRING.

1.1.  Relationship to the IETF RATS Working Group

   As noted, attestation-related technologies have existed for many
   years, albeit with no standard format and no standard means of
   conveying attestation information to a CA.  This draft addresses the
   latter, and is equally applicable to standard and proprietary
   attestation formats.  The IETF Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS)
   working group is addressing the former.  In [RFC9334], RATS defined
   vocabulary, architecture, and usage patterns related to the practice
   of generating and verifying attestations.

   In its simplest topological model, attestations are generated by the
   certificate requester and verified by the CA/RA.  Section 5 of
   [RFC9334] defines topological patterns that are more complex,
   including the background check model and the passport model.  This
   document may be applied to instantiating any of these topological
   models for CSR processing, provided the required security
   requirements specific to the context of certificate issuance are
   satisfied.

   The trust model defined in Section 7 of [RFC9334] identifies several
   roles that originate or forward attestations: the Attester; Endorser;
   and Verifier.  Attestations, or Evidence per [RFC9334], may be
   directed to an entity fulfilling one of these roles, including to an
   RA/CA acting as a Verifier.  An RA/CA may also forward attestations
   to a Verifier for evaluation.  Each attestation may contain one or
   more claims, including claims that may be required by an RA or CA.
   Attestations transmitted by these parties are defined in Section 8 of
   [RFC9334] as the "conceptual messages" Evidence, Endorsement, and
   Attestation Results.  The structure defined in this specification may
   be used by any of the roles that originate attestations, and is
   equally applicable to these three conceptual messages.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document re-uses the terms defined in [RFC9334] related to
   remote attestation.  Readers of this document are assumed to be
   familiar with the following terms defined in [RFC9334]: Evidence,
   Endorsement, Claim, Attestation Result (AR), Attester, Relying Party,
   and Verifier.  Per [RFC9334], the RA/CA is the Relying Party with
   respect to remote attestation.  This use of the term "relying party"
   differs from the traditional PKIX use of the term.  This
   specification uses RA/CA to refer to an [RFC9334] Relying Party,
   which may or may not include an integrated Verifier.

   The term "Certification Request" message is defined in [RFC2986].
   Specifications, such as [RFC7030], later introduced the term
   "Certificate Signing Request (CSR)" to refer to the Certification
   Request message.  While the term "Certification Request" would have
   been correct, the mistake was unnoticed.  In the meanwhile CSR is an
   abbreviation used beyond PKCS#10.  Hence, it is equally applicable to
   other protocols that use a different syntax and even a different
   encoding, in particular this document also considers messages in the
   Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) [RFC4211] to be "CSRs".  In
   this document, the terms "CSR" and Certificate Request message are
   used interchangeably.

   The term "hardware security module (HSM)" is used generically to
   refer to the combination of hardware and software designed to protect
   keys from unauthorized access.  Other commonly used terms include
   Secure Element, Trusted Platform Module, and Trusted Execution
   Environment.

   Since this document combines terminology from two domains, Remote
   Attestation (RATS) and X.509 PKI, it follows a naming convention to
   avoid ambiguity.  RATS terminology is written in uppercase (e.g.,
   Verifier), while X.509/PKI terminology is written in lowercase (e.g.,
   certification authority (CA)).  This distinction clarifies terms that
   exist in both domains; for instance, a Verifier refers to the RATS
   entity that processes Evidence, whereas a verifier refers to the PKI
   entity that validates certificates.  This convention is distinct from
   camel-case identifiers like "AttestationStatement", which denote
   ASN.1 types.

3.  Conveying attestations in CSRs

   The focus of this specification is the conveyance of attestations to
   a CA/RA as part of a CSR.  The following sub-sections define formats
   to support this conveyance, an optional mechanism to limit support to
   specific attestation types at the ASN.1 level, and bindings to the
   attribute and extension mechanisms used in certificate managment
   protocols.

3.1.  AttestationStatement and AttestationBundle

   The AttestationStatement structure (as shown in Figure 1) facilitates
   the representation of Evidence, Endorsements, and Attestation Results
   generated by an Attester, Endorser, or Verifier for processing by a
   Verifer or Relying Party, such as verification by a CA/RA.

   *  The type field is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER that identifies the format
      of the stmt field.

   *  The bindsPublicKey field indicates whether the attestation in the
      stmt field is cryptographically bound to the public key included
      in the CSR.

   *  The stmt field contains the attestation for processing,
      constrained by the type field.  Formats that are not defined using
      ASN.1 MUST define an ASN.1 wrapper for use with the
      AttestationStatement structure.  For example, a CBOR-encoded
      format may be defined as an OCTET STRING for AttestationStatement
      purposes, where the contents of the OCTET STRING are the CBOR-
      encoded data.

   *  The attrs field enables the inclusion of Attribute values that may
      inform the verification of the stmt.  This specification does not
      define any Attribute instances.

   *  The attrs field is not bound to the type of attestation to
      facilitate reuse of attribute types across attestation statement
      types and to allow for parsing of an AttestationStatement with no
      knowledge of the details of a specific type.

ATTESTATION-STATEMENT ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER

AttestationStatement ::= SEQUENCE {
   type   ATTESTATION-STATEMENT.&id({AttestationStatementSet}),
   bindsPublicKey BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
   stmt   ATTESTATION-STATEMENT.&Type({AttestationStatementSet}{@type}),
   attrs  Attributes OPTIONAL
}

             Figure 1: Definition of AttestationStatement

   In some cases, a CA may require CSRs to include a variety of claims,
   which may require the cooperation of more than one Attester.
   Similarly, a RA/CA may outsource verification of claims from
   different Attesters to a single Verifier.  The AttestationBundle
   structure, Figure 2, facilitates the representation of one or more
   AttestationStatement structures along with an OPTIONAL collection of
   certificates that may be useful for certification path building and
   validation to verify each AttestationStatement.  AttestationBundle is
   the structure included in a CSR attribute or extension.

   AttestationBundle ::= SEQUENCE {
      attestations SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF AttestationStatement,
      certs SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF LimitedCertChoices OPTIONAL,
   }

                 Figure 2: Definition of AttestationBundle

   At least one element in the attestations field SHOULD contain an
   attestation that is cryptographically bound to the public key that is
   the subject of the CSR containing the AttestationBundle.

   The CertificateChoices structure defined in [RFC6268], and reproduced
   below along with OtherCertificateFormat, allows for carrying
   certificates in the default X.509 [RFC5280] format, or in other non-
   X.509 certificate formats.  CertificateChoices MUST only contain
   certificate or other.  In this context, CertificateChoices MUST NOT
   contain extendedCertificate, v1AttrCert, or v2AttrCert.  Note that
   for non-ASN.1 certificate formats, the CertificateChoices MUST
   contain other with an OTHER-CERT-FMT.Type of OCTET STRING and data
   consistent with OTHER-CERT-FMT.id.  LimitedCertChoices is defined to
   limit the available options to certificate and other.

      CertificateChoices ::= CHOICE {
        certificate Certificate,
        extendedCertificate [0] IMPLICIT ExtendedCertificate,
             -- Obsolete
        ...,
        [[3: v1AttrCert [1] IMPLICIT AttributeCertificateV1]],
             -- Obsolete
        [[4: v2AttrCert [2] IMPLICIT AttributeCertificateV2]],
        [[5: other      [3] IMPLICIT OtherCertificateFormat]] }
      OTHER-CERT-FMT ::= TYPE-IDENTIFIER

      OtherCertificateFormat ::= SEQUENCE {
        otherCertFormat OTHER-CERT-FMT.
                &id({SupportedCertFormats}),
        otherCert       OTHER-CERT-FMT.
                &Type({SupportedCertFormats}{@otherCertFormat})}

   LimitedCertChoices ::= CertificateChoices (WITH COMPONENTS {\
                                                    certificate, other})

   The certs field contains a set of certificates that may be used to
   validate an AttestationStatement contained in attestations.  For each
   AttestationStatement, the set of certificates SHOULD contain the
   certificate that contains the public key needed to directly validate
   the AttestationStatement, unless the signing key is expected to be
   known to the Verifier or is embedded within the AttestationStatement.
   Additional certificates MAY be provided, for example, to chain the
   attestation signer key back to a trust anchor.  No specific order of
   the certificates in certs should be expected because certificates
   contained in certs may be needed to validate different
   AttestationStatement instances.

   This specification places no restriction on mixing certificate types
   within the certs field.  For example a non-X.509 attestation signer
   certificate MAY chain to a trust anchor via a chain of X.509
   certificates.  It is up to the Attester and its Verifier to agree on
   supported certificate formats.

3.2.  AttestationStatementSet

   AttestationStatementSet ATTESTATION-STATEMENT ::= {
      ... -- None defined in this document --
   }

              Figure 3: Definition of AttestationStatementSet

   The expression illustrated in Figure 3 maps ASN.1 Types for
   attestation statements to the OIDs that identify them.  These
   mappings are used to construct or parse AttestationStatement objects
   that appear in an AttestationBundle.  Attestation statements are
   typically defined in other IETF standards, in standards produced by
   other standards bodies, or as vendor proprietary formats along with
   corresponding OIDs that identify them.  AttestationStatementSet is
   left unconstrained in this document.  However, implementers MAY
   populate it with the formats that they wish to support.

3.3.  CSR Attribute and Extension

   By definition, attributes within a PKCS#10 CSR are typed as ATTRIBUTE
   and within a CRMF CSR are typed as EXTENSION.

   id-aa-attestations OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-aa 59 }

   -- For PKCS#10
   attr-attestations ATTRIBUTE ::= {
     TYPE AttestationBundle
     COUNTS MAX 1
     IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-attestations
   }

   -- For CRMF
   ext-attestations EXTENSION ::= {
     SYNTAX AttestationBundle
     IDENTIFIED BY id-aa-attestations
   }

            Figure 4: Definitions of CSR attribute and extension

   The Extension variant illustrated in Figure 4 is intended only for
   use within CRMF CSRs and is NOT RECOMMENDED to be used within X.509
   certificates due to the privacy implications of publishing
   information about the end entity's hardware environment.

   Due to the nature of the PKIX ASN.1 classes [RFC5912], there are
   multiple ways to convey multiple attestation statements: by including
   multiple copies of attr-attestations or ext-attestations, multiple
   values within the attribute or extension, and finally, by including
   multiple AttestationStatement structures within an AttestationBundle.
   The latter is the preferred way to carry multiple Attestations
   statements.  Implementations MUST NOT place multiple copies of attr-
   attestations into a PKCS#10 CSR due to the COUNTS MAX 1 declaration.
   In a CRMF CSR, implementers SHOULD NOT place multiple
   AttestationBundle instances in ext-attestations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate a value from the "SMI Security for PKIX
   Module Identifier" registry for the included ASN.1 module, allocate a
   value from "SMI Security for S/MIME Attributes" to identify two
   attributes defined within, and open a new registry.

4.1.  Module Registration - SMI Security for PKIX Module Identifier

   IANA is asked to register the following within the registry id-mod
   SMI Security for PKIX Module Identifier (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0).

   *  Decimal: IANA Assigned - *Replace TBDMOD*

   *  Description: CSR-ATTESTATION-2023 - id-mod-pkix-attest-01

   *  References: This Document

4.2.  Object Identifier Registrations - SMI Security for S/MIME
      Attributes

   IANA is asked to register the following within the registry id-aa SMI
   Security for S/MIME Attributes (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.2).

   *  Attestation Statement

   *  Decimal: IANA Assigned - This was early-allocated as 59 so that we
      could generate the sample data.

   *  Description: id-aa-attestation

   *  References: This Document

4.3.  Attestation OID Registry

   IANA is asked to create a registry that helps developers to find OID/
   Attestation mappings that may be encountered in the wild, as well as
   a link to their specification document and an indication as to
   whether the attestation is cryptographically bound to a public key.
   This registry should follow the rules for "Specification Required" as
   laid out in [RFC5226].

   Each row includes an OID and ASN.1 type that could appear in an
   AttestationStatement, and references to find the full specification.

   Registration requests should be formatted as per the registration
   template below, and receive a three-week review period on the spasm
   (mailto:spasm@ietf.org) mailing list, with the advice of one or more
   Designated Experts [RFC8126].  However, to allow for the allocation
   of values prior to publication, the Designated Experts may approve
   registration once they are satisfied that such a specification will
   be published.

   Registration requests sent to the mailing list for review should use
   an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register attestation
   attestation: example").

   IANA must only accept registry updates from the Designated Experts
   and should direct all requests for registration to the review mailing
   list.

4.3.1.  Registration Template

   The registry has the following columns:

   *  OID: The OID number, which has already been allocated.  IANA does
      not allocate OID numbers for use with this registry.

   *  Type: The ASN.1 type corresponding to the given OID.

   *  Description: Brief description of the use of the Attestation and
      the registration of the OID.

   *  Reference(s): Reference to the document or documents that register
      the OID and define the ASN.1 type for use with a specific
      attestation technology, preferably including URIs that can be used
      to retrieve copies of the documents.  An indication of the
      relevant sections may also be included but is not required.

   *  Change Controller: The entity that controls the listed data
      format.  For data formats specified in Standards Track RFCs, list
      the "IESG".  For others, give the name of the responsible party.
      This does not necessarily have to be a standards body, for example
      in the case of proprietary data formats the Reference may be to a
      company or a publicly-available reference implementation.  In most
      cases the third party requesting registration in this registry
      will also be the party that registered the OID.  As the intention
      is for this registry to be a helpful reference, rather than a
      normative list, a fair amount of discretion is left to the
      Designated Expert.

4.3.2.  Initial Registry Contents

   The initial registry contents is shown in the table below.  It lists
   entries for several attestation encoding OIDs including an entry for
   the Conceptual Message Wrapper (CMW) [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap].

   *  CMW

      -  OID: 1 3 6 1 5 5 7 1 35

      -  Type: CMW

      -  Description: id-pe-cmw

      -  Reference(s): [I-D.ietf-rats-msg-wrap]

      -  Change Controller: IETF

   The current registry values can be retrieved from the IANA online
   website.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a structure to convey attestations as
   additional information in CSRs, as well as an extension to convey
   that structure in the Certification Request Message defined in
   {[RFC2986]} and an attribute to convey that structure in the
   Certificate Request Message Format defined in {[RFC4211]}. The CA/RA
   that receives the CSR may choose to verify the attestation(s) to
   determine if an issuance policy is met, or which of a suite of
   policies is satisfied.  The CA/RA is also free to discard the
   additional information without processing.

   The remainder of this section identifies security considerations that
   apply when the CA/RA chooses to verify the attestation as part of the
   evaluation of a CSR.

5.1.  Binding attestations to the CSR’s public key

   Regardless of the topological model, the CA/RA is ultimately
   responsible for validating the binding between the public key and the
   attestation(s) in the CSR.  For CAs issuing in conformance with the
   CA/Browser Forum’s Code Signing Baseline Requirements, this means
   verifying the attestation of HSM generation pertains to the public
   key in the CSR.

   Multiple attestations from multiple sources, as envisioned in
   [RFC9334], can introduce additional complications as shown in the
   following example.

5.1.1.  Binding Multiple Claims to a CSR

   For example, a CA may have an issuance policy that requires key
   generation in an HSM on a company-owned platform in a known good
   state.  The CSR might contain three AttestationStatements originated
   by three different attesters:

   1.  an Evidence that a key pair was generated in an HSM;

   2.  an Endorsement that states a particular platform is company-
       owned; and

   3.  an Attestation Result stating a particular platform was in a
       known good state (e.g, up to date on patches, etc.).

   While each of these attestations may be independently correct, the
   CA/RA is responsible for confirming the attestations apply in concert
   to the public key in the CSR.  That is, the CA/RA must analyze the
   attestations to ensure that:

   1.  the attestation of HSM generation in AttestationStatement 1
       applies to the public key in the CSR;

   2.  the attestation of company ownership in AttestationStatement 2
       applies to the platform that contains the HSM; and

   3.  the attestation that a platform was in a known good state in
       AttestationStatement 3 applies to the platform that contains the
       HSM.

5.2.  Freshness

   To avoid replay attacks, the CA/RA may choose to ignore attestations
   that are stale, or whose freshness cannot be determined.  Mechanisms
   to address freshness and their application to the RATS topological
   models are discussed in [RFC9334].  Other mechanisms for determining
   freshness may be used as the CA/RA deems appropriate.

5.3.  Relationship of Attestations and Certificate Extensions

   Attestations are intended as additional information in the issuance
   process, and may include sensitive information about the platform,
   such as hardware details or patch levels, or device ownership.  It is
   NOT RECOMMENDED for a CA to copy attestations into the published
   certificate.  CAs that choose to republish attestations in
   certificates SHOULD review the contents and delete any sensitive
   information.

5.4.  Additional Security Considerations

   In addition to the security considerations listed here, implementers
   should be familiar with the security considerations of the
   specifications on which this specification depends: PKCS#10
   [RFC2986], CRMF [RFC4211], as well as general security concepts
   relating to remote attestation; many of these concepts are discussed
   in Section 6 of [RFC9334], Section 7 of [RFC9334], Section 9 of
   [RFC9334], Section 11 of [RFC9334], and Section 12 of [RFC9334].
   Implementers should also be aware of any security considerations
   relating to the specific attestation formats being carried within the
   CSR.
